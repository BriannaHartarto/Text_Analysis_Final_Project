        "On October 7, 2023, Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched an attack on the Gaza Envelope of southern Israel, leading to the deaths of over 1,100 individuals ([AJLabs, 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker)). Hamas reportedly took over 250 Israeli civilians and soldiers as hostages to prompt the state’s government to exchange them for imprisoned Palestinians. The attack launched the Israel-Hamas War, an armed conflict that has led to an on-going humanitarian crisis, with over 45,000 Palestinian lives lost ([UNICEF, 2024](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/there-nowhere-safe-go-600000-children-rafah-warns-unicef#:~:text=“Hundreds%20of%20thousands%20of%20children,homes%2C%20parents%20and%20loved%20ones)). The Israeli government’s response to the attack, and the US government’s support for the state, has been met with both support and outrage. On April 17, 2024, students at Columbia University launched a pro-Palestinian protest, establishing a Gaza Solidarity Encampment on the South Lawn ([Goldstein and Zuloaga, 2024](https://www.columbiaspectator.com/main/2024/04/18/in-focus-the-first-24-hours-of-the-gaza-solidarity-encampment/)). On April 24, 2024, students from hundreds of college campuses, including Harvard and the University of Southern California (USC), similarly established encampments, demanding their institutions to divest from the state among others ([Park, 2024](https://dailytrojan.com/2024/04/24/what-protesters-are-demanding-as-they-occupy-alumni-park/)).\n",
        "\n",
        "The protests have been a subject of controversy in the United States. While some groups have called pro-Palestinian students anti-Semitic, others have lauded the students for bringing attention to the genocidal acts committed by Israel in Gaza ([Moskowitz, 2024](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/21/chaos-columbia-jewish-moskowitz-santos-white-house-00153545)). Significantly, coverage of the protests have also diverged between student-run publications and national news outlets, with the latter focusing on the disruptions caused by students and allegations of anti-Semitism on college campuses ([Paul, 2024](https://fair.org/home/media-scorn-gaza-protesters-for-recognizing-corporate-reporters-arent-their-friends/)). In a country that values freedom of expression and journalistic integrity, analyzing how national news outlets covered the protests is significant to potentially uncover present biases. Ultimately, this project is relevant to public policy because by potentially identifying differences in the reporting of what occurred, findings from this project may provide insight into whether or not the policies put forth nationally in response to such protests are justified.

        "To analyze potential differences in how national news outlets and student-run publications covered the protests, I web scraped articles published between April 15 and May 15, 2024, from The Harvard Crimson, USC’s Daily Trojan, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. This timeframe captures the month-long period during which the encampments on both campuses were established and dismantled. Specifically, students set up encampments at USC and Harvard on April 24, 2024. Authorities dismantled USC’s encampment on May 5, 2024, and Harvard’s on May 14, 2024.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although I considered expanding the timeframe to include articles from October 7, 2023, to May 15, 2024, I chose to focus on the encampments because they were central to the student movement and received extensive media coverage.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Rationale for Publication Selection\n",
        "Initially, I intended to compare articles from Columbia University's Daily Spectator and USC's Daily Trojan due to the attention each school recieved from the media; however, I was unable to web scrape content from the Daily Spectator. I thus selected The Harvard Crimson and Daily Trojan due to accessibility, the sufficient number of articles they published on the protests (more than 15), and comparability. Both Harvard and USC are located in major cities and faced similar levels of media attention regarding protest activities. For national publications, I chose The New York Times and Wall Street Journal as they were accessible through Factiva and they are among the most widely circulated newspapers in the United States. I also decided to compare them due to differences in their political leanings. While media bias ratings are subjective, The New York Times is classified as left-leaning while The Wall Street Journal is classified as center-leaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also considered comparing student-run publications with local newspapers, such as the Harvard Crimson with The Boston Herald and Daily Trojan with The Los Angeles Times. Nevertheless, I decided against doing so as The Los Angeles Times may be considered a national newspaper and I was unable to access its content through Factiva. I also faced restrictions from web scraping from the following publications:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Columbia's Daily Spectator\n",
        "*   The Brown Daily Herald\n",
        "*   The Los Angeles Times\n",
        "*   The San Francisco Chronicle\n",
        "\n",
        "While I had acess to The New York Times and Chicago Tribune through Factiva, publications such as New York University's Washington Square News and the University of Chicago's Maroon did not have a large sample of articles to analyze in the specified time period.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Data Analysis Method\n",
        "Find an outline of the steps I took to compare and analyze the content of articles from each publication below:\n",
        "1.  **Web Scraping Articles from Student-Run Publications:** I scraped articles from The Harvard Crimson and Daily Trojan using a list of URLs. To focus on news coverage and ensure relevance, I excluded opinion pieces and letters to the editor from both student-run publications. I collected articles tagged with \"encampment\" and \"protest\" from The Harvard Crimson and \"protest\" and \"Israeli-Palestinian\" from the Daily Trojan. I used an automated function to automate the process ([Krisel, 2024](https://github.com/rskrisel/webscraping/blob/main/web_scraping.ipynb)). Since the Daily Trojan had only 21 articles while The Harvard Crimson had 51, I decided to take a random sample of 20 articles from each publication for analysis. Using an equal number of articles ensured comparability and prevented the results from being skewed toward one publication.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   **Data Cleaning:** I performed data-cleaning steps for the articles, including converting all of the text lowercase, stripping punctuation, and lemmatizing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   **Collecting Articles from National Publications:** I gathered articles from The New York Times and Wall Street Journal using Factiva ([Krisel, 2024](https://github.com/rskrisel/factiva_dataframe/blob/main/Create_spreadsheet_Factiva_data.ipynb)). I applied the following search terms: (protests OR encampment OR \"pro-Palestinian encampment\") AND (Palestine OR \"pro-Palestine\" OR \"anti-Semitism\" OR Israel) AND (\"college campus\" OR university). These terms captured relevant topics, including the encampments, protests, locations, and widely discussed concepts. To ensure consistency with the student-run publications I also took a random sample of 20 articles from each publication. Ultimately, I ensured that the sample used for analysis excluded opinion pieces and letters to the editor.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **TF-IDF Analysis:** I performed Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis on the articles collected from each publication to identify the most significant words. I created a custom list of stopwords to exclude common terms that would not meaningfully contribute to the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Data Visualization:** I grouped the results by publication and presented them using bar charts, highlighting the top 20 words with the top TF-IDF scores for each publication. I also grouped the results from the two types of publications and created bar charts to compare them.\n",

At universities like Brown and Northwestern, students obtained concessions including meetings with trustees to discuss divestment and scholarships for Palestinian students. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee agreed to call for a cease-fire in Gaza.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On the student demand for divestment from Israel, for instance, Harvard maintained that what the administration had agreed to do was to offer the students a kind of tutorial on how its $49.5-billion endowment worked.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The student coalition said that the university had agreed to meetings with the <span class=\"companylink\">Harvard Corporation</span>, the university's governing board, and the Harvard management company, which controls its endowment. ''Students will set the agenda, to begin discussions on disclosure, divestment and reinvestment,'' the coalition said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But in his statement on Tuesday, Dr. Garber never mentioned the word divestment.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The students said in their statement that Harvard had agreed to consider creating a Center for Palestine Studies. Dr. Garber, however, was much vaguer.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Concerning discipline, the student coalition said that the university had offered to extend leniency to the protesters, in part by retracting suspensions and beginning reinstatement proceedings immediately. ''The university is backing down on disciplinary measures and has agreed that over 60 students and student workers currently facing disciplinary procedures will have those cases expedited in line with precedents of leniency for similar actions in the past,'' the coalition statement said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Garber's statement said it would be up to individual schools under the Harvard umbrella to decide whether to roll back sanctions against students. But he said that ''with the disruption to the educational environment caused by the encampment now abated,'' he would ask the schools to quickly initiate reinstatement proceedings and evaluate the disciplinary cases against participants in the encampment.</p>\n",

''If you do so, you won't be punished. I don't see how Harvard will be able to enforce any of their rules in the future.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The student coalition acknowledged in its statement that the encampment was foundering as students left the campus with the end of the academic year. Harvard had put pressure on protesters by suspending some of them and barring them from campus. And on Monday, Harvard police officers circulated through the encampment taking photographs, leading many protesters to fear that the police would soon move in to clear the encampment.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Students there erected the tents at about 6:45 p.m., protectively surrounded by more than a hundred supporters, linking arms. After warnings to leave, campus safety officials deferred to the Hanover Police Department, the New Hampshire State Police, and other local agencies. Arrests began around 8:50 p.m.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In an email the day after the arrests, Dr. Beilock said that allowing the university's shared spaces to be taken over for ideological reasons is ''exclusionary at best and, at its worst, as we have seen on other campuses in recent days, can turn quickly into hateful intimidation where Jewish students feel unsafe.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Moshe L. Gray, the longtime executive director of the Dartmouth chapter of Chabad, an Orthodox Jewish group, said Dr. Beilock has taken ''a very principled stand'' since Oct. 7, making her stand out from her Ivy peers.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We're supposed to be a living example for how we manage divisive topics, and the most important thing in this process is that we don't engage each other as enemies,'' said Udi Greenberg, a history professor.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He said he fractured his shoulder during a scuffle with the police. An arrest report said that Mr. Tefft did not comply with orders and behaved aggressively during the arrest.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Annelise Orleck, the former head of Jewish Studies at the university, said she started taking videos of the arrests, when she was knocked to the ground as she tried to grab her phone from a police officer.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Alesandra Gonzales, a student reporter witnessed the professor's arrest. Then she, too, was arrested.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The last time so many campuses resorted to the police to confront student protesters was 1970 during the antiwar movement, said David Farber, an American history professor at the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Kansas</span> who has studied the 1960s. Students then were far more militarized than today, he said, noting that they firebombed campus buildings across the country.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''What's different about this period is there's been so many confrontations so fast, so many administrators calling in the cops so quickly,'' he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In the last month, more than 2,800 students have been arrested across the country.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On May 6, in a raucous online meeting with faculty, which quickly met the 500-person limit, Dr. Beilock tried to explain her fast reaction.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''An ongoing encampment is not something we can ensure the safety of,'' she said, ''especially if people outside Dartmouth decide to join with their own agendas.'' She cited <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span>, where some outsiders had joined the protests, but were certainly not in the majority.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Many faculty were not appeased. They said that the violence came from the police, not the protesters.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Five tents,'' wrote Carolyn Dever, a former Dartmouth provost, in the comments of the chat as Dr. Beilock spoke, which was repeated by many faculty members.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''This is not Columbia,'' another faculty member wrote.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Drop the charges,'' wrote another.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Matthew J. Garcia, a history professor, said Dartmouth used a big-city solution for the serene, rural town of Hanover.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It's like a place out of time,'' he said, adding, ''It is absurd to suggest that this is a hotbed of revolution.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The student newspaper also criticized the university in an editorial, demanding that the university urge the authorities to drop the charges against their reporters.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The college should be embarrassed,'' it stated. ''We expect a prompt and public apology from College President Sian Leah Beilock.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >University administrators responded defiantly at first, saying they supported the student reporters's right to clear their names ''through the legal process.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But as the backlash grew, and press freedom supporters slammed the university, Dr. Beilock relented, stating in a column in the student newspaper that the reporters should not have been arrested. ''We are working with local authorities to ensure this error is corrected,'' she wrote.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The charges against the reporters were dropped.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some on campus may not be demand-her-resignation angry. In a measure perhaps of the high social cost of supporting Dr. Beilock, the student council voted publicly for a no-confidence measure, 13-2, with three abstaining. After the student body president vetoed the public vote, citing inadequate deliberation, another vote, held privately, reversed the decision, 9-8 against, with two abstaining. The entire student body is now voting on a no-confidence measure.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The faculty is divided.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Our president is Jewish herself and has been on top of how Jewish students are feeling on the campus,'' said Sergei Kan, an anthropology professor. He said students at the protest were chanting offensive, ''borderline antisemitic'' slogans like ''From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.'' (Many supporters of the Palestinians say the phrase is a rallying cry for the dignity of Palestinians).</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''When they surrounded the tents and held hands, they were ready for a fight,'' Dr. Kan said, adding that the green ''belongs to all of us.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dartmouth's board has also supported the action. Liz Cahill Lempres, Dartmouth's board chair, said in an email to The Times that she had spoken with all board members and ''each one unequivocally supports'' Dr. Beilock.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In any case, the arrests may not deter the protesters. Months before tents became a symbol of pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses nationwide, Kevin Engel and other students set up two outside the Dartmouth administration building to seek divestment from Israel.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Engel, a first-year student, and another student were arrested on a trespassing charge, an early sign that Dr. Beilock was serious about cracking down on policy violators.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Beilock's decision, Mr. Engel said, turbocharged the student activists.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We're not going to stop,'' he said. ''Palestine will be free within our lifetimes. The students are taking up the burden of doing that work because no one else really is.''</p>\n",

A dispatcher told one caller pleading for help that they were ending the call because ''I have actual emergencies to handle.''</p>\n",

Gavin Newsom's office contacted the U.C.L.A. chancellor's office shortly after 11 p.m. to make sure that law enforcement officers were responding to the scene, and were assured that more officers were coming, according to a person familiar with the situation, who described the discussions on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to make them public.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But as the night wore on and there was still no intervention, the person said, the governor's office moved to circumvent local authority and ordered <span class=\"companylink\">California Highway Patrol</span> officers to the campus. The state officers began assembling on campus at 1:45 a.m., a few moments before L.A.P.D. riot police arrived, but it took another hour to quell the clashes.</p>\n",

The campus police chief, John Thomas, also did not comment. He told The Los Angeles Times that he had relied on private security officers who were not authorized to make arrests, but that he had done ''everything I could'' to keep students safe.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Instead, it appeared that contract security officers who did not have sufficient authority or numbers to halt the escalating melee had been caught by surprise and left to wait for reinforcements that did not arrive for hours.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Either the university was hesitant to do anything to get law enforcement involved, or law enforcement was dealing with authorization issues and political considerations from elected officials,'' said Ed Davis, a former Boston police commissioner who is familiar with crowd control policing issues.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Despite growing concern on campus about the pro-Palestinian encampment, complaints about antisemitic incidents and the potential for violence, in the early days of the protests, university officials made it clear that they would consider calling in outside police only as a last resort.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We are following University of California systemwide policy guidance, which directs us not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively, and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community,'' Mary Osako, the vice chancellor for strategic communications, said in a statement on April 26, shortly after the encampment had been set up.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On the night of April 30, a range of counterprotesters had gathered, a group that grew in size as expectations mounted that the police would begin dismantling the encampment. In interviews, witnesses said there had been little warning before counterprotesters went on the offensive.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One of the counterprotesters, Liel Asherian, was seen on video footage kicking at the encampment's plywood barrier, pulling boards to the ground and slamming a tennis racket against the wood that remained.

In an interview, he said he was not part of any group and had not intended to participate in a conflict.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Asherian said he had approached the pro-Palestinian encampment to ask some people why they were protesting. He said he believed Jewish people such as himself and Palestinians were like cousins, and he expressed alarm at the innocent Palestinians being killed in Israel's military campaign. But he said he disliked the disruptive tactics the pro-Palestinian protesters were using at U.C.L.A.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Also among the counterprotesters that night was Narek Palyan, an activist known for making frequent antisemitic statements, as well as comments critical of gay and transgender people. He said he went alone and was motivated to show up in part because he had seen a video of a Jewish woman on the pro-Palestinian side criticizing white people.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I wanted to go find her, specifically,'' he said, adding that he was not able to.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He said he spent much of the night asking people questions about their positions and trying to keep people from fighting by throwing makeshift weapons into nearby bushes.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I told them, 'This isn't ours,''' he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Anthony Cabassa, a self-described conservative independent journalist who posted videos of the chaos, said many people may have flocked to the scene on Tuesday night in the hours after U.C.L.A. declared the encampment illegal, believing that the police would move in to clear it and make arrests.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But then the counterprotesters descended on the protest, pulling metal gates away from the group and attacking protesters.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We were all waiting for the L.A.P.D. to show up, and they never did,'' Mr. Cabassa said in an interview. ''As the night went on, more and more pro-Israel folks started showing up, to the point where it was starting to get worrisome.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He said some people seemed to have arrived after seeing broadcasts of the tense scene that he and other livestreamers made, wanting to witness what would happen next.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''People were responding to my livestream and saying 'I just showed up because of you. I live nearby,''' he said. But others, he said, appeared to have planned for potential clashes, wearing all-black outfits and ski masks. Mr. Cabassa recalled being concerned about their presence.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In the end, more than 30 protesters were injured, according to the <span class=\"companylink\">Council on American-Islamic Relations</span> Los Angeles, before police dispersed the crowd.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Brian H. Levin, the founding director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said that, with religion and ethnicity at the heart of the recent protests, the attack had amounted to a hate crime.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''This comes at a time when major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, have had a surge in anti-Arab and Muslim hate crimes and have hit a record for anti-Jewish crimes,'' he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Levin watched the incident via livestream and said the weapons, the presence of some of the same people from previous protests and the waving of a yellow flag associated with Chabad-Lubavitch, a Hasidic Jewish movement, suggested some organizational coordination among the counterprotesters.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The director of the nearby Chabad House said the group had no role in the protest that night.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But he also noted that some of the implements wielded by the counterprotesters ''were spontaneous weapons of opportunity,'' and that some people ''may have just showed up randomly with their own separate xenophobic and religious bigotries.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The next day, after the counterprotesters had left, police officers moved in to remove the pro-Palestinian encampment, making more than 200 arrests.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >After almost two hours, the graduation ceremony for the Columbia School of Professional Studies concluded. Graduates, family and friends danced as Jay-Z's ''Empire State of Mind'' played. There were no protests, although a couple of students wore kaffiyehs alongside their graduation stoles. One student waved a Ukrainian flag as she walked across the stage.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Amoura Whitney, 24, was among those who graduated on Friday. She said she was frustrated by the last-minute cancellation of the main graduation ceremony. ''It definitely sucks because my immediate family was going to go to that one,'' said Ms. Whitney, who graduated with a masters in technology management.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The ceremony for the School of Social Work will be held there at 4:30 in the afternoon.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >N.Y.U. will hold its large commencement ceremony at Yankee Stadium next Wednesday. The New School will hold its commencement at Louis Armstrong Stadium in Queens next Friday. Graduations at other colleges continue through May 23.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At the end of a typical school year, Columbia's Morningside Heights campus becomes a sweeping venue with bleacher seating and some 15,000 graduates and their guests arrayed around the steps of Low Library. The university president takes center stage, officially conferring degrees on the graduates from the school's different colleges.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This year, it was not clear which of the 19 celebrations Dr. Shafik would attend. Students say they have rarely spotted her on campus since the police arrived on April 30 to clear out pro-Palestinian protesters from Hamilton Hall, a building they had occupied.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A Columbia spokeswoman, Samantha Slater, said she has been ''on campus regularly'' and noted that she had released a video to ''make sure they heard from her, whether on campus or not, as students take final exams.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The sidewalks in front of her official residence have been blocked off by barricades for about a week, after students gathered in front of her building at midnight and yelled at length for a noisy finals-week tradition known as the ''primal scream.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It's 65 degrees out,'' he said. ''Warm, sunny, brilliant. This is supposed to be our finals week. Do you see anyone on the lawns playing around having fun? There's nothing.'' Over the past week, he said, campus ''has been a ghost town that has felt like a police state.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik has not made an official announcement to the Columbia community since last week, when she explained that she had called in the police to remove protesters from Hamilton Hall because the escalation had brought ''safety risks to an intolerable level.'' She also called for civility to return to campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >She has not publicly acknowledged the allegations, made by protesters and some faculty members, that there was police brutality during the crackdown. Nor has she commented on how one officer, during the operation, accidentally fired his gun, hitting a wall. Instead, in her announcement, Dr. Shafik thanked ''the N.Y.P.D. for their incredible professionalism and support.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Thursday, she wrote an opinion essay for The Financial Times that look a long view on how universities can weather outside influences that seek to harden differences on campus. She also called on schools to ''better define the boundaries between free speech and discrimination.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Rather than tearing ourselves apart, universities must rebuild the bonds within ourselves and between society and the academy based on our shared values and on what we do best: education, research, service and public engagement,'' she said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik also wrote a letter to faculty members on Thursday, where she said ''I know that many of you are angry, and that you feel let down by me and by other University leaders for many different reasons.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >More than 200 faculty members at Columbia and Barnard have ''actively pledged to strike,'' said Rebecca Jordan-Young, a Barnard professor, during a news conference on Friday.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A strike at this time of year would mean faculty members would still engage in student-facing work, but would stop doing work for the university, such as creating and finalizing department budgets for the fall or doing work on committees.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''There is an assumption that the work of the university, even for faculty, closes at graduation and that is just not the case,'' said Shana Redmond, a Columbia professor, adding, ''We are stopping this constant request for labor until such time as these demands are met.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The demands included removing the police from campus and granting amnesty for students facing disciplinary action for pro-Palestinian speech and advocacy, Ms. Redmond said.</p>\n",

They refrained, records show, from demanding that Columbia embrace a specific new policy or tactic.

        "                     John Samuelsen, the international president of the union, wrote Monday to Nemat Shafik, the president of Columbia, saying she had ''epically failed to protect the safety of these university employees, who were forced to fight their way out of the building.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Samuelsen added that though Columbia had briefings with the police about the possibility that the protests could escalate, ''they conveyed none of that information to the union.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In a statement, Samantha Slater, a university spokeswoman, said that the ''employees who were in Hamilton Hall are valued members of the Columbia community, and we appreciate their dedication and service.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''When protesters chose to escalate the situation by occupying Hamilton Hall, they committed egregious violations of both University policy and the law, which is why we made the decision to bring in the N.Y.P.D.,'' she said. ''We are committed to ongoing work to help our entire University community heal.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On April 30, at about 12:30 a.m., a crowd of students had surrounded Hamilton Hall, cheering, as dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators entered. The building, on Columbia's central Morningside Heights campus, has symbolic significance as a place of student protest and had been occupied five times by student protesters since 1968.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For months, pro-Palestinian students had protested to urge the university to divest from Israel, among other demands, over the country's offensive in Gaza, eventually setting up a tent encampment. But the takeover of Hamilton Hall was a marked escalation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik, who also goes by Minouche, wrote in a letter to the police that before protesters entered the hall, ''an individual hid in the building until after it closed and let the other individuals in.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Torres was not surprised: He said he had caught a woman hiding under tables or behind doors ''three or four times'' over the last several weeks. And five days before the occupation, Lester Wilson, another longtime facilities worker in the building, had opened the door to a third floor closet just before midnight and found a surprise.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He said a woman was crouching in the slop sink, hiding and holding the door shut. Mr. Wilson said he brought her to university safety officers, and was not sure what happened next.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Both Mr. Torres and Mr. Wilson said they believed the occupiers had been highly organized, with knowledge of the location of the security cameras and exits, and backpacks full of supplies like rope, chains and zip ties.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The sole public safety officer in the lobby left when confronted by the occupiers and called for backup, several witness said. The protesters then quickly began barricading the main doors with furniture and chains. The occupiers appear to have timed their break-in with the midnight shift change, and the woman on duty was coming off her shift, the union said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Torres, who had worked there for five years, confronted some of the protesters, trying to protect what he saw as ''his building.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But as he saw the number of protesters grow to ''maybe 15 or 20,'' he said, he realized he could not fight them. He asked to be let out, but someone said the doors downstairs were already barricaded and that he couldn't leave.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He thought of his two young sons at home. He had no idea if other buildings were being taken over, too. Fear made him ''crazy,'' he said. He grabbed an older protester and ripped off his sweatshirt and mask, demanding to be let out.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The man said he could bring 20 people up to back him. ''I was terrified,'' Mr. Torres said. ''I did what I had to do.'' Mr. Torres then grabbed a nearby fire extinguisher and pulled the pin before someone persuaded him to calm down.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Wilson, 47, saw Mr. Torres facing off with protesters in the stairwell. He radioed his supervisors for help. Then he made his way down to the main doors. They were fastened shut with zip ties.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''So I begged them,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''I said, I work here, let me out, let me out.'' Eventually, someone cut the zip ties and pushed him outside, he said, then secured the doors again. He found the public safety officer and told her that his co-workers were stuck inside.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''God knows what could have happened,'' he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At about 1:10 a.m., roughly 30 minutes after Mr. Torres first encountered the protesters, a student protester in the lobby finally cut the cluster of zip ties on the front door handle and let him out along with the third worker, who spoke with The Times but asked not to be identified because he was concerned about privacy.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Torres filed a university accident report that day showing a raw wound on his knuckles and stating he had bruises on his neck. It also stated that he had been ''assaulted and battered, and wrongfully imprisoned.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I had no protection whatsoever from campus police or N.Y.P.D. and felt abandoned by those whose duty it is to protect me,'' he wrote in a document shared with <span class=\"companylink\">The New York Times</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Alex Molina, the president of the local union chapter, which represents both the facilities workers and the security guards, said that the guard on duty was not allowed to detain anyone and was unarmed.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Both Mr. Torres and Mr. Wilson said they strongly objected to the tactics of the occupiers, which they said had taken a toll on them. Neither man ever wants to work in Hamilton Hall again.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''What do you accomplish from that?'' Mr. Wilson said. ''You're giving people traumatic episodes over this stuff. I understand your protest, but why you got to take over a building? Why you got to take workers against their will?''</p>\n",

Mayor Eric Adams and other city leaders have accused so-called outside agitators -- professional organizers with no ties to the university -- of hijacking a peaceful student protest and spurring its participants to adopt ever more aggressive tactics.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Professional, external actors are involved in these protests,'' said Edward A. Caban, the New York City Police Commissioner. ''They are not affiliated with either the institutions or campuses in question, and they are working to escalate the situation.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A <span class=\"companylink\">New York Times</span> review of police records and interviews with dozens of people involved in the protest at Columbia found that a small handful of the nearly three dozen arrestees who lacked ties to the university had also participated in other protests around the country.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the examination also revealed that far more of the unaffiliated protesters had no such histories.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There was little evidence to suggest they had helped organize or escalate the protests, and many were arrested without having ever set foot on campus. Typical among them was Matthew Cavalletto, a 52-year-old computer programmer who has lived within a half-mile of Columbia for most of his life. Mr. Cavalletto, the gardener with the dog bowl, was arrested on the street outside Columbia after he stood in the middle of the intersection and refused to budge.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >City officials have said that 29 percent of those arrested at Columbia this week had no connection with the university. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams said that the arrest numbers ''speak for themselves.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''To ignore these facts and solely blame college students for the escalation of violence and hateful rhetoric would be both reckless and misleading, and unfair to students who did want to protest peacefully,'' said Kayla Mamelak, the spokeswoman.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Adams has said that even a small number of outsiders can inflame tensions and cause protests to veer into violence. And as evidence that the campus has been infiltrated, he has pointed to the presence there at various times of a 63-year-old career activist, Lisa Fithian, and Nahla Al-Arian, the wife of a man who faced terrorism charges in Florida nearly 20 years ago, and whose daughter was a graduate of Columbia's journalism school.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Ms. Fithian, who has written a book on protest tactics and charged money to run demonstrations and teach techniques for taking over the streets, was captured on video Tuesday apparently urging counterprotesters to step aside so that Hamilton Hall could be barricaded.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Also present on Tuesday -- and arrested inside Hamilton Hall -- was James Carlson, 40, the protester previously arrested in California. A lawyer, he was also accused of setting an Israeli flag on fire with a lighter at another protest outside Columbia's campus last month, court records show. Mr. Carlson, an advocate for animal rights, appeared to have participated in a wide variety of protests over the years, including demonstrations related to <span class=\"companylink\">Black Lives Matter</span>, immigration policy and environmental causes, according to posts on social media.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >His lawyer declined to comment. There was no indication Mr. Carlson was involved in organizing or leading the protests at Columbia.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For their part, the student organizers of the protests and student participants who were arrested disputed the idea that they had been manipulated by outside actors.</p>\n",

''I want to make sure it's very clear there were not 'external agitators,' as far as I can tell, who were inside the building.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Columbia has been a national focal point in one of the largest student protest movements in decades. Tensions over the war in Gaza have prompted a wave of student activism, resulting in the arrests or detaining of more than 2,300 people on campuses across the country.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The protests over Israel's offensive in Gaza had been brewing at Columbia for months. But the situation escalated on April 18, when the university's president, Nemat Shafik, called on the police to enter the private campus and clear out a pro-Palestinian encampment. More than 100 students were arrested.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik's decision led to more protests, both at Columbia and at campuses around the country. A new, larger encampment was established at Columbia. Less than two weeks after the Police Department initially cleared the encampment, a group of protesters, shortly after midnight, took over Hamilton Hall and barricaded themselves inside.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Later that day, police officers stormed the building through a second-floor window, rooted out the protesters and took others into custody on and around campus as well, making more than 100 arrests in all.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One of those arrested outside the university's gates was Rose Ceretto, a 27-year-old nanny who has lived in New York for a decade and asked to be identified by her middle name. She said that she had no ties to Columbia but worked nearby and had a long history of activism in New York. She said she had been arrested five times at other protests in recent years.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Ms. Ceretto said that she cared deeply about the mounting death toll in Gaza and had made her way onto the campus to provide students with supplies when the first tent encampments were constructed on Columbia's lawn. She scoffed at the idea that she or others like her would share aggressive protest tactics with students.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >During a news briefing on Thursday, Columbia's vice president for communications, Ben Chang, said figures supplied by the <span class=\"companylink\">New York Police Department</span> about those accused of occupying Hamilton Hall had confirmed the expectations of university leaders that many of the participants were not connected with Columbia.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''A significant portion of those who broke the law and occupied Hamilton Hall were outsiders,'' said Mr. Chang, who said the figures showed that 13 of the nearly four dozen people arrested in the takeover were not affiliated with Columbia.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the Times review of police records revealed a slightly different picture, showing that just nine of those people had no apparent ties to the university. The rest were current or former undergraduate or graduate students or university employees, The Times found. It was not clear why the university's numbers differed.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Overall, the records show, more than two-thirds of the demonstrators arrested on or near Columbia's campus this week had some connection to the university.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some, like Gregory Pflugfelder, a 64-year-old professor of Japanese history and gender studies in Columbia's department of East Asian languages and cultures, said they had not been participating in the protests at all.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Pflugfelder was taking photos of police officers assembling before the raid and did not go back inside his building when one of them told him to do so, he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I'm an historian of visual culture, and the recording of historic events is very important to me,'' he said, adding that he felt it was important for teachers to protect their students' rights. ''It was later reported to me that at least one of my students had seen me being walked in handcuffs down the street. I stood straight and walked tall.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As of Thursday evening, 46 people arrested inside Hamilton Hall had been arraigned in court. They each faced one misdemeanor charge of trespassing, a spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney's office said. At their arraignments, prosecutors said they might pursue additional charges. They agreed that all of the arrestees should be released without bail.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The university has said that students who occupied the building will face expulsion, and in a news briefing earlier this week, Mr. Chang said the university had begun suspending students who had not complied with an order to leave the encampment.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The claim that outsiders were whipping locals into organizing protests has been a common refrain in past social movements and was leveled at protesters during the civil rights movement, according to Aldon Morris, an emeritus professor of sociology and Black studies at <span class=\"companylink\">Northwestern University</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The outside agitator charge is in many ways a measure to delegitimize the protests and protesters,'' Mr. Morris said. ''It is a weapon that exists for the police in terms of dealing with protests to stop protests, to stifle protests.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Daniel Pearson, the saxophonist from Hell's Kitchen, said he had showed up at Columbia this week after heeding a call from pro-Palestinian groups on social media.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It was the second time the police have done so in the past nine days -- something many say they have never seen before at the university, which was founded in 1872 to educate the country's future leaders.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''One of the characteristics of wokisme is to divide the world into dominants and dominated, oppressors and the oppressed. Today, what we see happening on American campuses is a view classifying Israel as the oppressor and Palestine as the oppressed,'' said Chloé Morin, a political analyst who recently published a book denouncing wokisme. ''As a result, they can't accept antisemitism exists and that Jews can also be victims.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A well-known academic and expert on the Islam, Gilles Kepel, offered a similar analysis.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >That focus offers a vindication to German decisions to ban many antiwar protests and discourage public criticisms of Israel in the name of fighting antisemitism. That approach has come under international censure, particularly for its chilling effect on the arts world.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The most likely reason: Chinese authorities do not want student protests on their own campuses, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor emeritus of political science at <span class=\"companylink\">Hong Kong Baptist University</span>. ''They worry that the students will use that as an excuse to get mobilized,'' he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The main exception is Guancha, a nationalistic website with a long history of condemning the United States.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The country's two largest newspapers, El Tiempo and El Espectador, published editorials supporting the student protests this week.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At El Tiempo, editors saw the violent student arrests as an opportunity to remind readers of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, so it doesn't ''become part of the landscape,'' said Federico Arango, the opinion editor. He said he had lost count of the number of editorials the newspaper had published about the war.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Hopefully, the protests don't end only in controversy,'' Mr. Arango said. ''Hopefully, people see that those students aren't there for or against Biden or Trump.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This week, the country's left-leaning president, Gustavo Petro, announced he was severing diplomatic ties with Israel. He described the Israeli government's actions in Gaza as ''genocidal.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian expressed concern about the safety of American student activists and protesters. Last week, on X, he posted a video of police officers tackling students and handcuffing them, calling it ''repression'' and saying it ''clearly shows the dual policy and contradictory behavior of the American government toward freedom of expression.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Many ordinary Iranians have also taken to social media to express dismay that U.S. universities, which they perceived as bastions of freedom of expression and debate, had called in the police.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The most recent divestment proposal borrows heavily from the old one, using the same criteria laid out in 2020. Student protesters see it as a practical way for the school to pressure Israel to agree to a cease-fire, and cite as a precedent Brown's divestment from investing directly in South Africa during the 1980s, Darfur two decades ago and fossil fuels starting in 2017.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Supporters of Israel say those comparisons are off base, and see the nation's incursion in Gaza as a defensive response to <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span>'s October rampage and hostage taking. One longstanding response to such calls is that divestment from Israel stems from antisemitism, because activists are targeting the only Jewish country in the world and not seeking divestment from other nations accused of engaging in human-rights atrocities.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But there are also practical challenges with any effort to divest. One, simply, is identifying what to divest and how to define the terms of such a policy.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some academics question whether divestment works, with research finding that it has little to no impact on the bottom lines or behavior of targeted firms. Others point to the logistical complexity of divesting: As a private institution, Brown isn't required to disclose all of its endowment's investments, and in fact says almost nothing about them. Some 96 percent of its coffers are invested via outside asset managers.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Brown Divest Coalition said it wanted the university to sell off ''stocks, funds, endowment and other monetary instruments from companies facilitating and profiting from Israeli human rights abuses.''

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The students acknowledge that they don't even know if Brown invests in any of those companies. That's because what Brown does with its money -- and how the institution or any other school would get rid of them -- is hardly straightforward.</p>\n",

First, five of the protesting students will meet with five members of the corporation during its regular meetings this month.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >More recent history also provides part of the explanation. Many students protested for the first time after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, when Covid mask mandates were still in place.

His role in the organization of the protest is still unclear.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The day after New York City police officers stormed into the building through a second-floor window and rooted out the protesters from Hamilton Hall, new details emerged about both the takeover of the building and the operation to reclaim it. The details revealed a 17-hour-long student occupation that was destructive and damaging to property, amateurish, but in some respects, carefully organized.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Police Department list showed that most of the more than 100 people arrested in the sweep of Hamilton Hall and other parts of campus on Tuesday evening were in their late 20s, white and female. The average age was 27; more than half were women.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The records do not specify which people were arrested inside the building.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As of Thursday afternoon, at least 14 people who had occupied Hamilton Hall and later been arrested appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court. All were charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The occupation began early Tuesday morning, after a group of protesters decided to escalate their efforts to force Columbia to divest from companies supporting Israel.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As hundreds of protesters gathered around Columbia's central campus, forming a picket, a smaller group carried tents to a lawn on the opposite end of campus from Hamilton Hall, apparently to create a diversion, several witnesses said. At the same time, a second set of protesters approached the building.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A protester who had been hiding in the building after it closed let the others in, according to Columbia officials. Those protesters entered and told the security guard there to leave, said Alex Kent, a photojournalist who entered with them. They then began the process of bringing in supplies and barricading themselves in.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some of the demonstrators wore Columbia sweatshirts; others wore all-black. They also wore gloves and masks around their faces. They hauled in metal police barricades to help reinforce the doors against entry, according to images that Mr. Kent shot.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Kent and the police said that the protesters covered security cameras and threaded heavy metal chains through windows they had smashed in the building's French-style doors, securing them with bicycle locks. Protesters carried wooden desks and tables from classrooms to help reinforce the doors. They joined the pieces of furniture together with white plastic ties to make them harder to move, police images show. They secured another door with a vending machine.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >They got into a shoving match, Mr. Kent said, with a facilities worker who was still in the building, but the worker ultimately left. Outside, a career protest organizer in her 60s, Lisa Fithian -- whom Mayor Adams later labeled a ''professional agitator''-- tried to talk down two student counterprotesters who were blocking the throng from further barricading the entrance. The protesters tried to physically remove the two students, who ultimately walked away; Ms. Fithian was not arrested.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Police officials had been in regular conversations with Columbia for weeks about how to handle the increasingly entrenched student encampment. Now, university officials were in crisis mode.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The school's leadership team, including the board of trustees, met throughout the night and into the early morning, consulting with security experts and law enforcement, Nemat Shafik, Columbia's president, wrote in a letter to the community.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We made the decision, early in the morning, that this was a law enforcement matter, and that the N.Y.P.D. were best positioned to determine and execute an appropriate response,'' she wrote.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Once the police got that call sometime after 11 a.m., ''We had to put together a plan fast,'' according to Jeffrey Maddrey, the chief of department, who described the police response during a news conference the day after the arrests.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Amsterdam Avenue, outside Hamilton Hall, the police brought in a BearCat truck equipped with an extendable ramp, so that officers could bypass the barricaded front doors and climb into an upper-story window.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Just after 9:30 p.m., a group of officers in riot gear began lining up and then balancing across the BearCat's platform, one by one. Once inside, the police said, some students started throwing things at them.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Chief Maddrey said the police decided to deploy ''distraction devices''-- commonly called ''flash-bangs'' or stun grenades -- that produce a very strong noise and burst of light to temporarily disorient people's senses. At least eight loud bangs were heard echoing on footage from a police body camera.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Another team of officers entered through the building's front doors, cutting the metal chains and rapidly dismantling the items blocking the entryway, the body camera video showed.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While city officials praised the police for what they said was restraint in clearing the campus, protesters said some officers at the scene had been aggressive with demonstrators.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Protesters and independent journalists posted videos that appeared to show police officers pushing and dragging demonstrators outside of Hamilton Hall's main entrance during the arrests. The Columbia Spectator reported that outside Hamilton, officers threw protesters to the ground and slammed into them with metal barricades. Most journalists had been required by the police to leave the area and could not document the scene.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Students were shoved and pushed,'' said Cameron Jones, a student in Columbia's Jewish Voice for Peace chapter, who was watching from a nearby building. One protester lay motionless for several minutes, and was zip-tied while in that position, Mr. Jones said, before she came to and was carried away by the police.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It really seems as though the university, the police and Eric Adams are just trying to save face and not acknowledge the police brutality that happened on our campus,'' he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mayor Adams said there had been ''no injuries or violent clashes,'' and the Fire Department said no one in Columbia's immediate vicinity had been transported to the hospital.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >During the sweep of Hamilton Hall, one officer fired a single gunshot, according to Doug Cohen, the press secretary for the Manhattan district attorney. No one was struck, and no students were in the area when the shot was fired. It was not clear whether the shot was fired intentionally.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The charges against those arrested ranged from burglary, trespassing and disorderly conduct to criminal mischief, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration. More than half of the people arrested at Columbia -- those facing less serious charges -- were issued summonses and released, or issued appearance tickets. The remaining 46 were arraigned and released without bail.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some of those arrested at City College were students who had built an encampment earlier in the week in a plaza on the school's campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But they also included people who had joined a protest outside the campus's locked gates, on a public sidewalk. Many of the people on the police list who were arrested near City College appeared to be unaffiliated with the school.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On the list of protesters arrested at or near Columbia were a handful of people without clear ties to the university, including one man who apparently lives in the neighborhood and who was arrested outside, and a woman who describes herself online as a ''poet and farmer'' who went to college in Vermont.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Attempts to reach several of the protesters on the list were unsuccessful as of Thursday afternoon.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Columbia students received more news on Wednesday that their semester would not be returning to normal.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While classes had already ended Monday, the school announced that all final exams and academic activities on the Morningside Heights campus would be fully remote for the rest of the semester.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It is going to take time to heal, but I know we can do that together,'' Dr. Shafik wrote.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Speaking to supporters in Waukesha, Wis., Mr. Trump called for similar actions at universities across the country.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''To every college president, I say remove the encampments immediately,'' he said. ''Vanquish the radicals and take back our campuses for all of the normal students.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Both in Wisconsin and at a later rally in Freeland, Mich., Mr. Trump promoted a strong a law-and-order message, even as he contends with a criminal case in New York in which he is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Trump, who on Tuesday was held in contempt and fined $9,000 for violating a gag order in the trial that bars him from attacking witnesses and jurors, criticized the order. He laid into the judge who fined him, calling him ''crooked'' and ''conflicted'' at both rallies.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I have a judge who gags me,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I'm not allowed to talk about things. And nobody's seen anything quite like it.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And he reiterated his typical complaints about the criminal case: that it is a sham, that it is impossible for him to get a fair trial in deep-blue Manhattan and that the whole ordeal amounts to political persecution by President Biden -- a claim made without a shred of evidence but that has helped him bolster support among his base.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''What you're witnessing in New York is not a legal proceeding -- it's an unlawful exercise in very stupid and very evil politics,'' he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As Mr. Trump is tied down in court proceedings, he and Republicans have seized on the campus demonstrations as a wedge issue. They hope to foment discontent among Mr. Biden's Democratic base over his handling of Israel, while also pointing to the protests to support Mr. Trump's frequent contention that Mr. Biden is a weak leader.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In the past week, Mr. Trump has also used the protests to diminish violent episodes involving right-wing extremists that took place during his presidency. He tried to downplay the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, by calling it ''peanuts'' compared with the campus protests. One woman was killed and nearly 40 people were injured when a neo-Nazi plowed his car through a crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And building on his bid to portray federal prosecutors as politically motivated, Mr. Trump suggested the government would be lenient with the protesters, comparing them to supporters who he has said were treated harshly after they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a bid to overturn his 2020 election loss.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Though he has made small campaign stops in New York City, Mr. Trump has in the weeks since his trial started been visible more as a criminal defendant than as a political candidate. A planned rally in North Carolina last month was canceled at the last minute because of weather.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I've got to do two of these things a day,'' Mr. Trump told the crowd in Michigan. ''You know why? Because I'm in New York all the time with the Biden trial.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Trump's energetic demeanor at Wednesday's rallies stood in stark contrast to the stern speeches he has given in the hallway outside the courtroom, and to reports from the court that depict him as dour, glowering or, at times, asleep. He bantered lightly with members of the crowd in both states and repeatedly expressed pride at the size of his crowds.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But Mr. Trump's dark, and sometimes coarse, campaign message has changed little. He again argued that Mr. Biden's leadership was steering the country toward doomsday and stoked fears about immigration, accusing Democrats of creating ''mayhem'' at the border. He also repeated unsubstantiated claims that Democrats were encouraging migration in order to register undocumented immigrants to vote.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On a day when abortion was in the spotlight again, with Florida's six-week ban taking effect and Arizona lawmakers repealing their state's 1864 ban, Mr. Trump largely kept his focus elsewhere. But he defended his position in an effort to neutralize an issue that Democrats hope to make central in 2024.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Trump has tried a balancing act on the issue, arguing that all abortion rights should be left to the states even as he has voiced opposition toward strict six-week bans. And he stressed the need to consider the political implications of calling for further abortion restrictions as Republicans try to win in November, saying in Michigan that ''a lot of bad things will happen beyond the abortion issue, if you don't win elections.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In Wisconsin, he presented his views as a kind of compromise. ''Some people will be very happy,'' he said. ''Some people won't be as happy. But time will make this.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Still, in Michigan, he praised the conservative justices who had overturned Roe v. Wade, singling them each out by name. His remarks there came shortly after Vice President Kamala Harris visited Florida, where she called the state's new restrictions ''another Trump abortion ban,'' part of a larger effort by Democrats to tie Mr. Trump to strict limits on the procedure.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At both rallies, Mr. Trump also railed against Mr. Biden's handling of the economy, arguing that the president's economic policies were hurting the middle class and that Mr. Biden had not done enough to fight inflation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Both parties are focused intently on winning Michigan and Wisconsin, two battleground states that were critical to Mr. Trump's 2016 victory but flipped to Mr. Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump visited both states last month, shortly before his New York criminal trial began.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The <span class=\"companylink\">Republican National Committee</span> is holding its 2024 convention in Milwaukee, which Mr. Trump acknowledged in nearby Waukesha. ''That means you've got to vote for us, because we're spending our money in your state to have the big convention,'' he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The two states were also central in Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Last week, he was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an investigation by the Michigan attorney general's office into efforts he and his allies took to subvert Mr. Biden's victory in the state. So far, 15 Republicans who acted as fake electors have been charged.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For much of the weekslong protest at Columbia, university leaders have remained in the background, making much of their public pronouncements through campuswide advisories.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In their absence, Mr. Adams, a Democrat and former police officer, has forcefully stepped in, embracing a role that adheres to his law enforcement background, his reputation as a mayor focused on reducing disorder and his strong support for Israel over many years.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Adams relied on support from Orthodox Jewish voters in a close race for mayor during the 2021 Democratic primary.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Friday, Mr. Adams said in a radio interview on WABC that he had met with several college presidents and told them: ''Soon as one tent comes up, take that tent down.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Wednesday, Mr. Adams made the rounds on morning news shows, eager to become the public face behind the police intervention.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On MSNBC's ''Morning Joe,'' the mayor made clear that he had urged Columbia to take action.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It was clear after I was briefed probably two days ago -- the extent of the outside agitators,'' he said, adding: ''I really encouraged them to look into this, for the safety of students.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He added that he was proud of the police officers who had raised the American flag, saying that the city was ''not surrendering our way of life to anyone.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It's despicable that schools would allow another country's flag to fly in our country,'' said Mr. Adams, who has made it a frequent practice to hoist other countries' flags over one of the city's most historic parks. ''So blame me for being proud to be an American.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Blame did come from left-leaning Democrats. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X that Mr. Adams's approach was ''the opposite of leadership and endangers public safety,'' calling it ''a nightmare in the making.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Doug Muzzio, a political scientist and former professor at <span class=\"companylink\">Baruch College</span>, said the mayor's choice to adopt a ''tough guy'' image would alienate some, but that it might be a wise political choice.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''He had to know he had to piss off a lot of people, but he made the judgment that more people would have favored what he did, and I think he was right,'' Mr. Muzzio said.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Though she acknowledged that students demonstrating in solidarity with Gaza had a right to protest, she said that students who were not protesting had the right to be free from harassment. ''They should not be living in fear because you're claiming an exercise of your rights,'' she said on Wednesday.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To temper the perception that the police used unnecessary force against the students, Mr. Adams and police officials sought to amplify the notion that the protests were being orchestrated by outside activists.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Rebecca Weiner, the deputy commissioner of the Police Department's counterterrorism bureau, said at the news conference on Wednesday that police had seen a ''normalization and mainstreaming of rhetoric that is associated with terrorism.''

Instead, a subgroup of protesters took over a campus building, Hamilton Hall, in the middle of the night.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Finally, on Tuesday evening, the university brought in the police again, to rout protesters from the building and encampment. More than 100 people were arrested.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Across the nation, different schools are facing the same question, with no easy answers. Some administrators have called in the police. Others have met with students at the negotiating table. In all cases, university officials are no doubt watching the school calendar, counting the days until the semester ends, but also until a flood of families comes to campus for graduation ceremonies.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The difficulty administrators face stems in large part from one of the demands that student protesters are making: that schools end financial ties with companies supporting Israel. Students at Columbia and elsewhere also want universities to publicly disclose all of their investments, to ensure accountability for divestment.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For universities, considering those demands raises a host of problems, both logistical and political, that may make acquiescing nearly impossible.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The protesters point to victories by previous campus movements that won similar demands, including the 1968 takeover of Hamilton Hall and other campus buildings, which ultimately led the school to disaffiliate from a weapons research institute involved in the Vietnam War and end its plans to build a gym in a Harlem park. In 1985, Columbia became the first Ivy League university to divest from South Africa after student protests.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I think we can see throughout history, especially on Columbia's campus, when escalations like these have happened, there has been success,'' said Cameron Jones, an undergraduate protester with Columbia's Jewish Voice for Peace, a pro-Palestinian group that was suspended last year for not following protest rules. ''You can look at the fight for divestment from apartheid South Africa, fossil fuel divestment, private prison divestment, escalations do work. So that's why we as students are doing it.''</p>\n",

According to the agreement, which has been signed by students who represent the Brown Divest Coalition, students say they will remove their tents, among other things.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In exchange, Brown agreed that five students would be invited to meet with members of the Corporation of Brown University to discuss divestment. The corporation will hold a vote on the matter at its October 2024 meeting, Christina H. Paxson, Brown's president, wrote in a letter to the community.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The student movement saw it as a victory that the issue even got to the table. Still, that does not mean the university will ultimately decide to divest.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We do hope a vote by the Brown Corporation in October, either for or against divestment, will bring clarity to an issue that is of longstanding interest to many members of our community,'' said Brian Clark, a university spokesman, in a statement.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Columbia, for its part, has faced enormous internal and external pressures, making any official move toward divestment in Israel highly unlikely, even though its undergraduates voted to support divestment in an April referendum.</p>\n",

        "                     Nemat Shafik, Columbia's president, appeared in Congress two weeks ago and largely agreed with the Republican-led committee that the pro-Palestinian protests on her campus included antisemitic rhetoric and were making the campus feel unsafe for many Jewish students. Any steps that the university takes to distance itself from Israel would bring additional criticism and amplify the pressure Dr. Shafik faces to clamp down.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In a statement Monday, Ms. Shafik said Columbia would not divest from Israel, but that it had offered protesters ''an expedited timeline for review'' of new proposals to go before the Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing, the university group focused on ethical investing.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Columbia is facing at least three lawsuits from Jewish students arguing that the school has allowed a discriminatory environment for Jewish students to emerge on campus. The school is also facing congressional and federal civil rights investigations, and pressure from donors, alumni groups and parents. There are hundreds of Israeli students on campus, and thousands of Jewish students, though only some say they feel threatened.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In addition, most states, including New York, also have laws that bar public institutions from divesting from Israel, or ban them from entering into contracts with companies that call for boycotts of Israel, to guard against the <span class=\"companylink\">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement</span> that targets Israel. Opponents see the movement as antisemitic for singling out the world's only Jewish-majority state.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There are also technical reasons that divestment would be more difficult now than it was following protests in decades past.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In the 1980s, weeks of sit-ins at Columbia led the school to announce that it would be selling $39 million in stock from companies like <span class=\"companylink\">Coca-Cola</span>, <span class=\"companylink\">Ford Motor</span> and <span class=\"companylink\">Mobil Oil</span> because of their investments in South Africa.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But compared to universities in the '80s, those today invest less of their endowments in individual stocks, with more tied up in general index funds and private equity, which are handled by managers independent of the schools. Private universities report some of their holdings in public portfolios, but that's a tiny sliver of the pie.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''For places like Columbia and N.Y.U. that heavily invest in hedge funds, it becomes pretty hard to even know if you're spending money in Israel,'' said Chris Marsicano, a professor of educational studies and public policy at <span class=\"companylink\">Davidson College</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In a written proposal submitted last December, activists at Columbia listed a number of companies they wanted the school to divest from, including <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span>, which has a large contract with the Israeli military, and <span class=\"companylink\">Airbnb</span>, which advertises listings on Israeli settlements in the West Bank. It also named the university's indirect holdings in companies like <span class=\"companylink\">Caterpillar</span>, a maker of armored bulldozers for the Israeli government, which Columbia owns in an exchange-trade fund managed by <span class=\"companylink\">BlackRock</span>, the world's largest asset manager.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The school's socially responsible investing advisers have created a list of companies in tobacco, private prisons and fossil fuels that the university does not directly invest in. But that committee rejected student organizers' divestment proposal back in March.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Monday, as Brown protesters were packing up their tents after agreeing to continue talks about divestment next fall, Columbia shut down negotiations with the student coalition that had led the encampment, saying the talks had come to an impasse. On Tuesday, it called in the police to remove protesters.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >By Wednesday, the atmosphere was quiet on both campuses.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >'A wake-up call'</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. James's video, which was publicized by a right-wing outlet on Thursday and then reported on by <span class=\"companylink\">The New York Times</span> and others, drew wide attention, including from President Biden, whose spokesman issued a statement saying, ''These dangerous, appalling statements turn the stomach and should serve as a wake-up call.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Rev. Michael McBride, a founder of Black Church PAC, who has pressed for a cease-fire in Gaza, said Mr. James's comments were not representative of the antiwar movement.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''You can go to a protest and find anything you're looking for,'' said the Rev. McBride, who leads a church in Berkeley, Calif. ''If you're looking for that, then you'll find it.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At Columbia, the CUAD student protest organization on Friday posted a statement on <span class=\"companylink\">Instagram</span> that said, ''Khymani's words in January do not reflect his view, our values, nor the encampment's community agreements.'' The statement added, ''In the same way some of us were once Zionists and are now anti-Zionists, we believe unlearning is always possible.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But for university administrators, Mr. James's case has presented a serious challenge.</p>\n",

Mr. James, who said in a statement last week that his words were ''wrong,'' could not be reached for comment.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''When leadership learned of the video, it took immediate steps to ban James from campus,'' a Columbia spokesman said this weekend.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some executives are privately pondering what they can do. The most common course of action so far has been to pull back on individual donations. <span class=\"companylink\">The New England Patriots</span> owner Robert Kraft, for example, said this week that he was ''no longer comfortable supporting <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span>.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But businesses have other levers that affect universities, and some of those levers would undoubtedly put more pressure on universities to take action against antisemitism.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Here's one out-of-the-box thought experiment: Most businesses scrutinize their vendors quite carefully and maintain approved lists of vendors whose policies align with their own. Companies could scrutinize universities, a main source of their talent, as they would any other vendor. They could tell universities that they won't hire their students unless the schools take decisive action to stem antisemitism.</p>\n",

A decision to stop hiring all students from a particular school would inevitably punish some who have nothing to do with the worst offenders on campus.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Many university endowments send questionnaires and conduct due diligence on the internal policies of the Wall Street firms -- examining their D.E.I. policies, for example.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Businesses may be unlikely to rush into formally patrolling universities' policies by adopting either of these theoretical maneuvers, but they might amp up the pressure in some other way through their informal preferences.

The concept has also faced plenty of skepticism. Medical professionals say proactive screening technologies are not proven to achieve better outcomes for patient health or longevity. And the verdict is still out on the business model.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I would be super happy if this turned out to make me no money, but we actually solved real issues in the world for real people,'' Ek said.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Xi Jinping thought is essentially about making China great again, both domestically and externally, by 2050. It's based on a mythical conception of restoring China to its historic place at the center of the world.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Xi wants to change the liberal international order by capturing institutions, like the United Nations, and transforming how they function to make them more China-friendly at the minimum or Sinocentric at the maximum.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It also helps to explain why he is so hard-line on issues like Taiwan. From his perspective, China cannot be made great again without taking Taiwan back one way or another. And it will need to happen by 2050.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What does this mean for business?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Xi is not against the private sector or foreign multinationals per se. The question is whether they are serving China's national interest or not. If they are, terrific. When they cease to do so, they can sink or swim.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For example, <span class=\"companylink\">Tesla</span>. When China wanted to crack the electric vehicle sector, <span class=\"companylink\">Tesla</span> was given special concessions to build its giga-factory in Shanghai.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Thursday, another protest at the university was scheduled, but the scene was much more calm, with university administrators handing out fliers with rules for protesting.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For years, U.S.C. was regarded in some circles as the ''University of Second Choice'' for affluent students who had been rejected by schools with more elite academic status. It was singled out by The Princeton Review back in the early 1990s for its ''sports, fraternities, sororities, good-looking students, college newspaper, and dating.'' Local residents routinely noted that its powerful network of Southern California alumni balanced the scales.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In a push to elevate the school's national prestige, Steven Sample, its president from 1991 to 2010, and his successor, C.L. Nikias, raised billions of dollars in donations and research grants to transform the institution. With great wealth came some sensational misconduct.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Among the scandals: a pay-to-play college admissions conspiracy that made U.S.C. a central part of the ''Varsity Blues'' case; a campus gynecologist accused of sexually abusing hundreds of patients; a bribery and fraud scheme benefiting the son of a Los Angeles politician; and a drug-abusing medical school dean.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The current president, Carol Folt, was hired five years ago to help U.S.C. rebound from the onslaught. Those past challenges, however, were of a different breed than the uproar confronting U.S.C. this month. For more than a week, the complex fight between supporters of Israel and supporters of the Palestinians has unfurled like a script borrowed from some other school.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Social movements have run through the university, including large turnouts for demonstrations in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by police officers in Minnesota. But U.S.C. has rarely had the level of activism seen at some other large California universities, particularly in the public University of California system, and its administrators have shown less tolerance for it.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Last week, citing security concerns, university officials canceled the valedictory address that was to be given by a Muslim biomedical engineering major. The cancellation came after pro-Israel groups criticized a pro-Palestinian link on the student's social media bio. Hours later, the university released all of the planned speakers and featured guests who were scheduled to appear with her, including Jon M. Chu, the director of ''Crazy Rich Asians,'' and Billie Jean King, the celebrated athlete.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Thursday, university officials announced that U.S.C.'s main stage commencement event, which was expected to draw 65,000 students and family members, would be canceled completely because of new safety measures. Graduating students will still attend smaller ceremonies held by their individual schools within the university.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Folt notably refrained from commenting publicly on the cancellation of the valedictory speech. The university provost, Andrew T. Guzman, said in a statement that the valedictorian had ''no free-speech entitlement to speak at a commencement.'' In Los Angeles, civic leaders struggled to frame the decision in the usual local context.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid inflaming the conflict or drawing protesters to their homes, several business and academic leaders praised U.S.C. for canceling the speech, saying the move deprived activists of a free stage that the leaders felt could have led to an ugly and dangerous political confrontation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some influential academic leaders sympathized with Dr. Folt, saying the national mood had placed her in a ''damned if you do, damned if you don't'' situation, especially given the criticism other college presidents have faced for not confronting pro-Palestinian protesters.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Others asked how it was that U.S.C. was able to secure its commencement last year when one of former President Barack Obama's daughters graduated, yet was incapable this year of handling one speech by an undergraduate.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And many people inside and outside Los Angeles questioned the university's treatment of the valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, a daughter of South Asian immigrants and first-generation college student who had been selected by faculty from among more than 200 students who met the academic qualification. There was no indication that Ms. Tabassum was planning to use her speech to make a political statement, they said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The message this sends to graduating seniors is that when a threat to free speech arrives, it's time to cave,'' The <span class=\"companylink\">Los Angeles Times</span> wrote in a blistering editorial about the decision to cancel her speech. In a statement, Ms. Tabassum accused the university of giving in to a heckler's veto.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Pro-Palestinian student groups called on the university to reconsider, and hundreds of students marched through campus over the weekend in a silent protest. A columnist for the Jewish news site The Forward wrote that ''once U.S.C. decided to offer Tabassum the top student speaking spot, the university needed to stand by its decision,'' but instead had ''compounded the shortsightedness and stoked even more anger: It blamed Jews.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Pro-Palestinian students tried to occupy the commencement site on Wednesday by erecting a tent camp at Alumni Park, similar to the encampments set up at <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University in New York</span> and the <span class=\"companylink\">University of California, Berkeley</span>. Within hours, the U.S.C. campus police removed signs and began seizing tents, and a clash between protesters and officers unfolded.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Hundreds of demonstrators stayed on the campus quad throughout the day. ''Disclose! Divest!'' marchers shouted, calling on the university to cease investing in suppliers of Israeli weapons.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But unlike Berkeley, which has had a protest encampment since Monday, U.S.C. would tolerate very little more. Administrators sought help from the <span class=\"companylink\">Los Angeles Police Department</span> to remove protesters from the quad before nightfall. By late Wednesday, 93 people were arrested on the U.S.C. campus. In a statement, Mr. Guzman, the provost, said that ''many'' of the protesters ''do not appear to be affiliated with U.S.C.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The intensity of the crowds -- and the university's forceful reaction -- have disoriented faculty, students and community members.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The response to it was insane,'' Cameron Davidson, a 21-year-old junior from Tucson, Ariz., said on Thursday, a day after he participated in the protest. ''You would have thought that there was a shooting on campus. They completely locked it down. You know, it wasn't a proportional response at all.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Melina Abdullah, a racial justice activist and professor of Pan-African studies at California State University, Los Angeles, said she was struck by the savvy of the current students.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''U.S.C. used to stand for University of Spoiled Children, University of Special Connections,'' said Ms. Abdullah, who earned a doctorate in 2002 from U.S.C. and later co-founded the Los Angeles chapter of <span class=\"companylink\">Black Lives Matter</span>, as she spoke over the din of police helicopters and chanting demonstrators on Wednesday.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Like the city around it, U.S.C. has grown far more diverse over the years, she noted. The student body is now nearly 20 percent Asian, nearly 16 percent Latino, more than 6 percent Black and more than 27 percent international. First-generation college students made up more than a quarter of the freshman class last year.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >William G. Tierney, a professor emeritus of higher education who has worked on the campus since 1994 and has written about the national administrative response to the campus protests, said in an interview that the administration at U.S.C. seemed to have both underestimated and overestimated its students. Even with the amplification of social media, he said, the student response to the canceled speech initially seemed mild: ''At a lot of other campuses, the place would have exploded.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He wondered what might have happened if Dr. Folt, the university president, had simply greeted the protesters with doughnuts on Wednesday morning instead of calling in the police.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I'm serious about that,'' he said. ''She could have said, 'I know you're upset about this and I know we have different opinions, but I want us to continue talking.'''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some local organizations, however, supported the crackdown. In a statement, the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles said that ''while we believe in peaceful civic discourse, these protests have escalated to the point of creating a dangerous climate for Jews on campus.'' The group demanded that U.S.C. and other Los Angeles universities ''immediately restore a place that is safe for all Jews.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What would come next was not immediately clear, as the campus protests continued to spread across the country. (''Tulane? Vanderbilt? Who knew?'' Mr. Yaroslavsky marveled.)</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Thursday, university officials said the gates would ''remain closed to anyone without proper U.S.C. identification or verifiable business purpose, at least through the weekend.'' Dr. Folt was unavailable for comment.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On the quad where officers and protesters clashed a day earlier, a white picket fence stood on Thursday, surrounding a tidy courtyard with manicured hedges and a fountain.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Jody Armour, a U.S.C. law professor, said that he was ''shocked and astonished'' at the impact the protests had had on the institution where he had worked for 25 years.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''This school's brand for the last several years has been, we are student-centered,'' Mr. Armour said. ''We want to promote freethinking citizens who are active participants in the political process. And they were doing this morning what we teach them to do, what we hope that they will do. And our response was to crack down on them with violence.''</p>\n",

        "                        Nemat Shafik, <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span>'s besieged president, faced skeptics on Wednesday in a meeting with the university senate that could vote to censure her over her handling of protests on the Upper Manhattan campus.</p>\n",
        "</td></tr><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" class=\"index\"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik, who last week called in the police officers who made more than 100 arrests while they cleared a student protest encampment, is facing mounting calls for her resignation, including from House Speaker Mike Johnson, who visited Columbia on Wednesday. If Dr. Shafik ultimately remains atop Columbia, her meeting with the university senate made plain that it will likely be as a scarred figure.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik defended her choice to summon the New York authorities to campus, according to three people who attended the meeting at the law school. But, according to two of those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private meeting, Dr. Shafik used part of her roughly hourlong appearance to acknowledge that the decision to bring in the police had exacerbated the problems. She said she believed, though, that it was necessary for the safety of protesting students.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The group could vote on a censure as soon as Friday, but some senators were discussing the possibility of pursuing a more moderate course in the aftermath of Wednesday's meeting.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Although predicting the outcome of a university senate vote is an inexact science -- the body includes in excess of 100 faculty members, students, alumni and administrators from a wide range of academic disciplines -- a draft censure resolution was unsparing. In it, Dr. Shafik was accused of violating fundamental rules by ignoring a 13-member senate executive committee that had unanimously rejected her request to ask the police onto campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >By calling in the police anyway, the resolution said, Dr. Shafik had endangered both the welfare and the futures of the arrested students. Dr. Shafik had already angered many at Columbia with her testimony on Capitol Hill on April 17, when she tried to placate Republican lawmakers but provoked outrage on campus, in part for not robustly defending academic freedom.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Carol Garber, a professor of biobehavioral sciences, said Wednesday's meeting included the voices of many senate members who were ''upset and hurt,'' with many ''unhappy with some of the statements'' Dr. Shafik made in Washington.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Protest management is a particularly resonant matter for modern Columbia presidents, professors and students, who have known well how Grayson L. Kirk's tenure came to a turbulent close after widespread criticism of his handling of demonstrations in 1968.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To some of Dr. Shafik's critics, her choice last week echoed that strategy and should yield a similar outcome.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >So far, the university senate is not expected to call for Dr. Shafik's removal, with a censure vote meant to signal serious disapproval, not a demand for an ouster. Some senators fear allowing outsiders too great a voice in university affairs. And another draft of the resolution was in the works that stopped short of a censure but was described as more of an expression of disapproval with the administration.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It really isn't a precedent any academic institution wants to set,'' Dr. Garber said in an interview. ''We shouldn't be bullied by someone in Congress. If something happens on Friday, are we capitulating to an outside force?''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But to many people on campus, Columbia has already done so -- whether by allowing protesters, for now, to rebuild their encampment or by turning to the police last week.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And on Wednesday, it was far from settled how long the resurrected protest zone would last, or whether Columbia would again seek arrests.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Not even 12 hours after Columbia's predawn assertion of progress in its negotiations with the demonstrators, a protest leader all but dismissed some of the university's claims.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To extend talks, according to the university, the protesters agreed to remove a significant number of the tents erected on the lawn. Columbia also said the protesters had pledged that non-students would leave the encampment, and that they would bar discriminatory or harassing language among the demonstrators.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But on Wednesday morning, an organizer announced to other students at the encampment that they would not be ''doing the university's job of removing people from this camp for them,'' insisting that demonstrators would not become ''cops to each other.\" And the organizer declared that the protesters were ''committed to staying here and having people stay here.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >University officials did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday about the protest leader's remarks at the encampment, which some demonstrators said they expected to be free of police activity until at least Friday. But Columbia has set an early Friday deadline for an agreement and left open the possibility of dismantling the camp using ''alternative options.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Protesters and university officials were also at odds over what was said during their urgent talks. A student group, which had been suspended by the university, insisted that administrators had suggested that the National Guard could be deployed to campus, a tactic Mr. Johnson urged after he met with Dr. Shafik on Wednesday.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Protesters say their vigil has been peaceful. And a spokeswoman for Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York noted that the governor said publicly she had no plans to send the Guard onto the campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Ben Chang, a spokesman for Columbia, said the claim that the university threatened that the Guard could be deployed was ''completely baseless.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Separately on Wednesday, Columbia's board defended Dr. Shafik, saying in a statement that it ''strongly supports President Shafik as she steers the university through this extraordinarily challenging time.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The board added, ''During the search process for this role, President Shafik told us that she would always take a thoughtful approach to resolving conflict, balancing the disparate voices that make up a vibrant campus like Columbia's, while taking a firm stance against hatred, harassment and discrimination. That's exactly what she's doing now.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The events at Columbia are at the center of a spate of unrest rocking campuses from California to Connecticut as the end of the semester approaches. Across the country, administrators have struggled to balance principles like open debate with the need to protect Jewish students. Some demonstrations have included hate speech, threats or support for <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span>, the armed group based in Gaza that led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, sparking the war that has left tens of thousands of people dead.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Brown University said it had warned about 90 students Wednesday morning that their new encampment broke university rules and that they faced school discipline. At California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, dozens of protesters occupied a building on the campus, which has been closed since Monday. And on the other end of the state, at the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Southern California</span>, about 100 protesters set up an encampment, which security officials quickly moved to dismantle.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But many other campuses, even ones that had seen protests earlier in the week, were largely quiet, with students and professors alike preparing for final exams.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At Columbia, the encampment on Wednesday at times seemed far quieter than it had, especially when Dr. Shafik's first deadline had loomed.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Tents that protesters frantically broke down Tuesday night stood pitched again. A group of Muslim students prayed together, and protesters passed through a canopy to get food from Dunkin' and Popeyes.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At each entrance to the encampment, demonstrators stood guard. Not far away, Columbia's preparations for commencement went on.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Researchers say the impact of any divestment would ultimately be negligible on the businesses and on Israel.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the pro-Palestinian activists, many of whom are Jewish, see divestment as a clear and achievable way to force colleges to take action on the issue, an important symbolic victory and one that would raise awareness of their concerns.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Henisz pointed to research that has found little to no impact of university divestments on firm behavior. He added that if an organization like a university was selling its stake in a company against its values, the buyer would likely care less about the issue than the university would.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In a statement released last week, Yale said that it would not be divesting from weapons manufacturing because it did not ''meet the threshold of grave social injury'' that was necessary for divestment, according to the school's Corporation Committee on Investor Responsibility, or C.C.I.R. The school said it had offered to provide students an avenue to speak with trustees, but those talks fell through Sunday.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Other universities that have refused to divest from Israel include Michigan State -- whose Board of Trustees said it would not consider divestment ''of any kind\" earlier this month -- as well as the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Michigan</span> and <span class=\"companylink\">American University</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Student protesters have submitted proposals of divestment to organizations like Yale's C.C.I.R., which seeks to ensure that the school's investments are made in an ethical way.

At Brown, such a committee recommended in 2020 that the university divest from certain companies that ''profit from human rights abuses in Palestine,'' but the university president, Christina Paxson, refused to move the proposal forward.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The secretive deliberations that followed over 24 frantic hours have sent Columbia into a crisis over free speech and safety unlike any the campus has seen since 1968.

She suspended the students and ordered New York City police in riot gear to arrest more than 100 activists who refused to leave on Thursday afternoon.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But instead of quelling the protests, Dr. Shafik's decision appeared to backfire. By this week, she was besieged on all sides.</p>\n",

Dr. Shafik's own faculty threatened to revolt over an ''unprecedented assault on student rights.'' At least one major Jewish donor cut off support. And while the White House voiced deep concern, the very Republican lawmakers she had set out to appeal to called for her resignation.</p>\n",

The university is home to large Jewish and Arab student populations, and boasts a leading Middle Eastern studies department, a dual degree program with <span class=\"companylink\">Tel Aviv University</span> and a rich history of student activism dating back to the 1960s.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik, an international finance expert with few prior connections to Columbia, has conceded the university was unprepared for the outpouring that followed <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span>'s Oct. 7 attack. She had been ceremonially inaugurated just days before. But as the protests escalated, and the presidents of <span class=\"companylink\">Harvard University</span> and the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Pennsylvania</span> lost their jobs after botching their own appearances before Congress in December, she slowly began clamping down.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik was determined not to make the same mistakes as her Ivy League counterparts, according to the people familiar with her preparation. Where their testimony came off as haughty and convoluted, she wanted to project humility and competence.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The university handed the committee thousands of pages of documents, including sensitive records that almost never become public. They showed that Columbia had suspended more than 15 students and removed five professors from the classroom, including at least three facing accusations that they had made Jewish students feel unsafe.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Though her testimony on the disciplinary cases made supporters of academic freedom furious, the approach appeared to work inside the hearing room. Dr. Shafik defended free speech rights, but said universities ''cannot and should not tolerate abuse of this privilege.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Grudging Republicans largely accepted the answers.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Columbia beats Harvard and U Penn,'' Representative Aaron Bean, Republican of Florida, teased from the dais.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In the predawn hours before Dr. Shafik's scheduled testimony on Wednesday, dozens of students poured out of dorms and apartments into a grassy quad outside Columbia's main library and pitched tents. When campus awoke, a sign posted on the lawn announced the ''Gaza Solidarity Encampment,'' openly defying rules governing demonstrations.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Columbia administrators issued their first warning to participants to disperse at 9:30 a.m., just as Dr. Shafik was preparing to take the witness stand. But by the time she got back to Covington's glass-walled offices to turn her prep room into a war room, the students had not budged.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The genocide in Gaza is too unbearable for us to continue to allow our university to ignore every single democratic attempt that we have tried,'' said Maryam Alwan, an undergraduate who helped organize the demonstration.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Organizers said they held hours of discussions with a senior university vice president to see if the two sides could find an off-ramp. The students were demanding the university divest from any financial interests enriching Israel and grant amnesty for all activists under investigation for protest actions, among other demands.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To some observers, though, it looked as if both sides were more interested in proving a point than de-escalating.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''You had hard-heads on both ends who wanted a confrontation,'' said Dr. James Applegate, a professor of astronomy and member of the University Senate's executive committee. ''They got what they wanted.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik, meanwhile, began a series of calls with university deans, some of whom worried the university was proceeding without proper contingency plans. Around 5 p.m. on Wednesday, she formally notified the University Senate of her intention to call in the Police Department. Its executive committee replied with explicit disapproval, Dr. Applegate said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The decision was destined to be fraught. The city's police officers have rarely been welcomed on campus since the 1968 protests, when they helped violently remove students occupying university buildings at the height of the antiwar movement.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But Dr. Shafik was adamant that the rules be enforced. The police warned her the encampment would only get harder to root out the longer it lasted. And, with Congress and the Biden administration scrutinizing how Columbia was handling antisemitic threats, she had legal concerns about failing to act. She began making arrangements for the police to arrive the next day.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I have determined that the encampment and related disruptions pose a clear and present danger,'' she wrote to the Police Department the next day.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Wednesday evening, Dr. Shafik did not head back to New York to be on hand when the police arrived, however. She decided to keep a longstanding plan to attend a private dinner in Washington for the Bezos Earth Fund, according to a university spokeswoman. Dr. Shafik ended up fielding so many calls that she never had time to eat, she said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Back on campus, just before the university's final deadline to disperse passed that night, students in the encampment gathered for a meeting. Closing their eyes for a secret ballot, they were asked for a show of hands if anyone wanted to disband rather than face repercussions.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Harvard Yard was shut to the public. Nearby, at campuses like <span class=\"companylink\">Tufts</span> and Emerson, administrators weighed how to handle encampments that looked much like the one that the police dismantled at Columbia last week -- which protesters quickly resurrected. And on the West Coast, a new encampment bubbled at the <span class=\"companylink\">University of California, Berkeley</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Less than a week after the arrests of more than 100 protesters at Columbia, administrators at some of the country's most influential universities were struggling, and largely failing, to calm campuses torn by the conflict in Gaza and Israel.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >During the turmoil on Monday, which coincided with the start of Passover, protesters called on their universities to become less financially tied to Israel and its arms suppliers. Many Jewish students agonized anew over some protests and chants that veered into antisemitism, and feared again for their safety. Some faculty members denounced clampdowns on peaceful protests and warned that academia's mission to promote open debate felt imperiled. Alumni and donors raged.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And from Congress, there were calls for the resignation of Columbia's president, Nemat Shafik, from some of the same lawmakers Dr. Shafik tried to pacify last week with words and tactics that inflamed her own campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The menu of options for administrators handling protests seems to be quickly dwindling. It is all but certain that the demonstrations, in some form or another, will last on some campuses until the end of the academic year, and even then, graduation ceremonies may be bitterly contested gatherings.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For now, with the most significant protests confined to a handful of campuses, the administrators' approaches sometimes seem to shift from hour to hour.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I know that there is much debate about whether or not we should use the police on campus, and I am happy to engage in those discussions,'' Dr. Shafik said in a message to students and employees early Monday, four days after officers dressed in riot gear helped clear part of Columbia's campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''But I do know that better adherence to our rules and effective enforcement mechanisms would obviate the need for relying on anyone else to keep our community safe,'' she added. ''We should be able to do this ourselves.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Protesters have demonstrated with varying intensity since the Oct. 7 <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span> attack on Israel. But this particular round of unrest began to gather greater force last Wednesday, after Columbia students erected an encampment, just as Dr. Shafik was preparing to testify before Congress.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At that hearing in Washington, before a Republican-led House committee, she vowed to punish unauthorized protests on the private university's campus more aggressively, and the next day, she asked the <span class=\"companylink\">New York Police Department</span> to clear the encampment. In addition to the more than 100 people arrested, Columbia suspended many students. Many Columbia professors, students and alumni voiced fears that the university was stamping out free debate, a cornerstone of the American college experience.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The harsher approach helped lead to more protests outside Columbia's gates, where Jewish students reported being targeted with antisemitic jeers and described feeling unsafe as they traveled to and from their campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The spiraling uproar in Upper Manhattan helped fuel protests on some other campuses.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We're all a united front,'' said Malak Afaneh, a law student protesting at <span class=\"companylink\">University of California, Berkeley</span>. ''This was inspired by the students at Columbia who, in my opinion, are the heart of the student movement whose bravery and solidarity with Palestine really inspired us all.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The events at Columbia also rippled to Yale, where students gathered at Beinecke Plaza in New Haven, Conn., for days to demand that the university divest from arms manufacturers.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Yale's president, Peter Salovey, said Monday that university leaders had spent ''many hours'' in talks with the protesters, with an offer that included an audience with the trustee who oversees Yale's Corporation Committee on Investor Responsibility. But university officials had decided late Sunday that the talks were proving unsuccessful, and Dr. Salovey said, they were troubled by reports ''that the campus environment had become increasingly difficult.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The authorities arrested 60 people on Monday morning, including 47 students, Dr. Salovey said. The university said the decision to make arrests was made with ''the safety and security of the entire Yale community in mind and to allow access to university facilities by all members of our community.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In the hours after the arrests, though, hundreds of protesters blocked a crucial intersection in New Haven.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We demand that Yale divests!'' went one chant.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Free Palestine!'' went another.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Far from being cowed by the police, protesters suggested that the response at Beinecke Plaza had emboldened them.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It's pretty appalling that the reaction to students exercising their freedom of speech and engaging in peaceful protest on campus grounds -- which is supposed to be our community, our campus -- the way that Yale responds is by sending in the cops and having 50 students arrested,'' said Chisato Kimura, a law student at Yale.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The scene was less contentious in Massachusetts, where Harvard officials had moved to limit the possibility of protests by closing Harvard Yard, the 25-acre core of the campus in Cambridge, through Friday. Students were warned that they could face university discipline if they, for instance, erected unauthorized tents or blocked building entrances.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Monday, Harvard's Palestine Solidarity Committee said on social media that the university had suspended it. National Students for Justice in Palestine, a loose confederation of campus groups, said it believed the decision was ''clearly intended to prevent students from replicating the solidarity encampments'' emerging across the United States. Harvard said in a statement that it was ''committed to applying all policies in a content-neutral manner.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Elsewhere in the Boston area, protesters had set up encampments at Emerson College, the <span class=\"companylink\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> and <span class=\"companylink\">Tufts University</span>. But those protests, for now, appeared more modest than the ones at Yale and in New York, where demonstrators constructed an encampment outside N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >N.Y.U. officials tolerated the demonstration for hours but signaled Monday night that their patience was wearing thin. Police officers gathered near the protest site as demonstrators ignored a 4 p.m. deadline to vacate it. As nightfall approached, sirens blared and officers, donning helmets and bearing zip ties, mustered. Prisoner transport vans waited nearby.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Students, students, hold your ground!'' protesters roared. ''N.Y.U., back down!''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Soon enough, police officers marched on the demonstration.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Today's events did not need to lead to this outcome,'' said John Beckman, a university spokesman in a statement. But, he said, some protesters, who may not have been from N.Y.U., breached barriers and refused to leave. Because of safety concerns, the university said it asked for assistance from the police.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At Columbia, Dr. Shafik ordered Monday's classes moved online ''to de-escalate the rancor.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >She did not immediately detail how the university would proceed in the coming days, beyond saying that Columbia officials would be ''continuing discussions with the student protesters and identifying actions we can take as a community to enable us to peacefully complete the term.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some students and faculty members said support for Dr. Shafik was eroding, with the university senate preparing for the possibility of a vote this week to censure the president. Supporters of the censure complained that Dr. Shafik was sacrificing academic freedom to appease critics.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But Dr. Shafik was castigated on Monday by the very people she was accused of appeasing when at least 10 members of the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. House of Representatives</span> demanded her resignation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Over the past few days, anarchy has engulfed <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span>,'' Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York and one of Dr. Shafik's chief interrogators last week, wrote with other lawmakers. ''As the leader of this institution, one of your chief objectives, morally and under law, is to ensure students have a safe learning environment. By every measure, you have failed this obligation.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A university spokesperson said that Dr. Shafik was focused on easing the strife and that she was ''working across campus with members of the faculty, administration, and board of trustees, and with state, city, and community leaders, and appreciates their support.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Amid the acrimony, and with scores of green, blue and yellow tents filling the Columbia encampment, parts of the campus sometimes took on an eerie, surreal quiet on a splendid spring day.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The unease was never all that far away, though, even with many Jewish students away from campus for Passover.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''When Jewish students are forced to watch others burning Israeli flags, calling for bombing of Tel Aviv, calling for Oct. 7 to happen over and over again, it creates an unacceptable degree of fear that cannot be tolerated,'' Representative Daniel Goldman, Democrat of New York, said outside Columbia's Robert K. Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >By then, in another symbol of the crisis enveloping Columbia, Mr. Kraft, an alumnus and owner of the <span class=\"companylink\">New England Patriots</span>, had launched his own broadside and suggested he would pause his giving.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff,'' he wrote in a statement, ''and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In February, Nemat Shafik, the president of <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span>, told the school's senate that she sensed a ''low level of trust'' in the administration.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The university senate is expected to vote, possibly as early as Wednesday, on a resolution censuring Dr. Shafik, a reaction to her testimony before Congress and the arrests of more than 100 student protesters.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A draft of the resolution, circulated Monday, accused Dr. Shafik of violating ''the fundamental requirements of academic freedom,'' ignoring faculty governance and staging an ''unprecedented assault on student rights.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The resolution is expected to be introduced by two members of the 111-seat senate. It specifically states that the resolution is not a call for Dr. Shafik's resignation, but the resolution also calls for the censure of other university officials, including Claire Shipman and David Greenwald, the chairs of Columbia's board of trustees.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Asked for a comment on the proposed resolution, a spokesman for Columbia issued a statement: ''President Shafik is focused on de-escalating the rancor on Columbia's campus. She is working across campus with members of the faculty, administration, and board of trustees, and with state, city, and community leaders, and appreciates their support.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Such a vote, if it passed, would be largely symbolic. The senate, which is made up of faculty, students and administrators, does not have the power to remove a president. And Dr. Shafik, who goes by Minouche, seems to retain the support of the university's board of trustees. Ms. Shipman and Mr. Greenwald testified with her before Congress, and echoed her conciliatory approach to House Republicans.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But a censure vote, whether it passes or not, reflects the depth of anger among faculty members over the arrests of the student protesters, which faculty members say Dr. Shafik ordered without proper consultation with the university senate's executive committee.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I have the sense,'' said David E. Pozen, a law professor, ''that a very broad swath of the faculty, with very different views on the situation in Gaza and Israel, believes that President Shafik's recent actions are alarming.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Professors are also incensed over her testimony before Congress last Wednesday, where they say she capitulated to the demands of conservative Republicans on questions of academic freedom. And they are incredulous that her office disclosed information to Congress about pending internal investigations of faculty members, which are usually confidential.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Not all faculty are on board.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Andrew R. Marks, the chair of the department of physiology at Columbia's medical school and a member of the university senate's executive committee, said that antisemitism on campus, not Dr. Shafik's leadership, was the problem.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I want her to succeed,'' he said. ''I want her to be able to manage all of this and get us out of this mess.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik was a nontraditional choice for president. Despite having served as president of the <span class=\"companylink\">London School of Economics</span> for six years, Dr. Shafik, an economist, spent most of her career with the <span class=\"companylink\">International Monetary Fund</span>, the <span class=\"companylink\">Bank of England</span>, and the <span class=\"companylink\">World Bank</span>. She had few ties to Columbia.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And the mood had already been tense before the hearing. In a letter on April 5, 23 faculty members warned Dr. Shafik that, in agreeing to appear before Congress, she would be walking into a ''political theater of a new McCarthyism.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As they predicted, the hearing did not improve things. Among their complaints was that she did not strongly defend academic freedom, while agreeing that some contested phrases -- like ''from the river to the sea'' -- might warrant discipline.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik had thrown ''academic freedom and <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span> faculty under the bus,'' said Irene Mulvey, national president for the <span class=\"companylink\">American Association of University Professors</span>, a national group that supports academics.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >After the student arrests, more than 50 of the 90 full-time faculty in the law school released a letter on Sunday condemning Dr. Shafik for bringing the police to campus, and for suspending more than 100 student protesters.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A number of Columbia affiliates -- the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, the Columbia Law School Human Rights Institute, and the head of the Union Theological Seminary -- have also denounced the decision.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There was also consternation over Columbia's decision to disclose to Congress internal information about professors under investigation, the same type of detail that Harvard has resisted releasing to the committee.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In a private letter on April 16, the day before the hearing, Columbia supplied the House committee with details about eight professors and one teaching assistant who were under investigation for alleged violations of university anti-discrimination regulations.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One of those professors, Dr. Joseph Massad, a professor of Middle Eastern studies, had not been informed of the pending investigation by an outside investigator, according to the letter to the House obtained by <span class=\"companylink\">The New York Times</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Even so, Dr. Shafik answered specific questions about Dr. Massad during the hearing and an article he wrote in The Electronic Intifada, published the day after the Oct. 7 <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span> attack on Israel.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It described how <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span> paragliders overwhelmed the vaunted Israeli defenses, delivering what Dr. Massad, who is of Palestinian descent, described as a ''death blow'' to confidence in the military. Adjectives used in the piece, including ''awesome,'' were interpreted as supportive of the invasion.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >When Representative Elise Stefanik pressed Dr. Shafik about the university's response to the article, Dr. Shafik responded, ''He was spoken to by his head of department and his dean.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''And what was he told?'' Ms. Stefanik asked.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''That that language was unacceptable,'' Dr. Shafik responded.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Massad, who has been a subject of campus controversy before, said he had been the target of death threats since the hearing.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In a statement, Columbia acknowledged that the university ''generally does not disclose ongoing investigations, including to protect complainants.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But, it said, ''in this case, Congress's interest required the university to do so.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The statement added, ''Representative Stefanik's direct line of questioning on this matter obligated Professor Shafik to provide accurate information regarding the investigation.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But for many of the professors, the breach of confidentiality amounted to being placed on public trial with no chance to defend themselves.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Katherine Franke, a law professor at Columbia, was also identified as being under investigation, in the letter and during the hearing.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On social media, she demanded an apology from Dr. Shafik for not correcting the record when Ms. Stefanik, a Republican from New York, claimed that she had made an inappropriate comment about Israeli students -- a charge that Ms. Franke said Dr. Shafik knew was incorrect.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Albert Bininachvili, an adjunct professor in political science, was also on the list, based on what appears to have been one student's complaint that he made antisemitic remarks directed at Jewish students.</p>\n",

He described the email from memory: ''We call on the administration to engage the protesters in good faith dialogue to bring the protest to a peaceful end with all deliberate speed. We do not approve of police presence on campus at this time.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The email was sent to the administration about 6 p.m. Wednesday, and Dr. Applegate said he received no further official word until the next day, when he was told that the police had been brought in.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Those demonstrations took a dark turn on Saturday evening, as protesters targeted some Jewish students with antisemitic vitriol that was captured in video and pictures, both inside and outside the campus.

Mr. Adams said the police had already increased its presence near the campus and would investigate any potential violations of the law.</p>\n",

Her testimony, meant as an assertive display of Columbia's actions to combat antisemitism, angered supporters of academic freedom and emboldened a group of protesting students who had erected an encampment of about 50 tents on a main lawn in the campus this week.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >University officials said the tents violated the school's policies and called in the <span class=\"companylink\">New York Police Department</span> on Thursday, leading to the arrests of more than 100 <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span> and Barnard College students who refused to leave. But the police involvement only fueled the uproar. Students pressed on with their ''Gaza Solidarity Encampment,'' sleeping in the cold without tents on a neighboring lawn, and some began to erect tents again on Sunday, without Columbia's permission.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Students who support the protesters say there is a wide range of opinion among Jewish students at Columbia. ''To say that it's unsafe for Jewish people, to me, indicates that you're only speaking about a certain portion of Jewish people,'' Mr. Miner, 27, said at the university on Sunday.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We are totally opposed to any sort of antisemitic speech,'' he added. ''We are here to, you know, stand in solidarity with Palestine. And we refuse -- our Jewish members refuse -- to equate that with antisemitism.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Ms. Gubbay said that throughout the past six months her friends -- particularly those who are Palestinian and other students who are Muslim -- have been injured by the police and censored for their activism. Though she was not involved in the organizing of the encampment, she went there for the Sabbath on Friday, attended a speech given by a participant in Columbia's intense 1968 protest and brought hot tea for friends.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''There's been a lot of amazing solidarity in terms of other students coming on campus, hosting Shabbats, hosting screenings, having faculty give speeches,'' Ms. Gubbay said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Columbia officials have previously said there have been several antisemitic incidents on campus, including one physical attack in October -- the assault of a 24-year-old Columbia student who was hanging fliers a few days after the <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span> attacks on Israel in October.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While many Jewish students had left campus to celebrate Passover, which begins on Monday evening, the rising tensions led at least one rabbi on campus to suggest that the Ivy League school was no longer safe and that Jewish students should leave.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Elie Buechler, an Orthodox rabbi who works at Columbia, sent a WhatsApp message to a group of more than 290 Jewish students on Sunday morning saying that campus and city police had failed to guarantee the safety of Jewish students ''in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy.'' He recommended that students return home ''until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It is not our job as Jews to ensure our own safety on campus,'' wrote Rabbi Buechler, the director of the Orthodox Union's Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus at <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span> and Barnard College. ''No one should have to endure this level of hatred, let alone at school.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Citing Passover preparations, Rabbi Buechler declined to be interviewed, but he said that his message was meant as a personal statement and did not reflect the views of the university or Hillel, the Jewish organization on campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Indeed, in an apparent response, Hillel issued a statement on Sunday afternoon saying that the organization did not believe that Jewish students should leave Columbia, but it pressed the university and the city to step up safety measures.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We call on the university administration to act immediately in restoring calm to campus,'' Brian Cohen, the group's executive director, wrote. ''The city must ensure that students can walk up and down Broadway and Amsterdam without fear of harassment,'' he added, referring to the avenues that run alongside the Upper West Side campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Noah Levine, 20, a sophomore at Columbia and an organizer with Jewish Voice for Peace, said they found the rabbi's comments ''deeply offensive.''</p>\n",

        "</td></tr><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" class=\"index\"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Testifying before the same panel on Wednesday, she readily agreed with Republicans' premise that pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia is shot through with anti-Jewish bigotry, and explained how, under her leadership, Columbia is cracking down. Fifteen students, she said, had been suspended, and six more were on disciplinary probation. The visiting scholar Mohamed Abdou, who expressed support for <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span>, <span class=\"companylink\">Hezbollah</span> and Islamic Jihad, ''will never work at Columbia again,'' she said, and several other members of the faculty are under investigation. If it had been up to her, she said, the stridently anti-Zionist professor Joseph Massad would never have gotten tenure. There was some confusion at the hearing about whether Massad was still chairman of an academic review committee, but if he was, Shafik pledged that he would be removed. (Columbia later confirmed that his chairmanship was scheduled to end after this semester.)</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >By bending over backward to be agreeable, Shafik emerged from the four-hour grilling largely unscathed. All that's been damaged is Columbia's guarantee of academic freedom.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Shafik appeared with two chairs of Columbia's board of trustees, Claire Shipman and David Greenwald, and with David Schizer, a former dean of Columbia's law school who is one of the chairs of the school's antisemitism task force. The university, said Shipman, was taking steps to restrict student protests: ''One of the excellent recommendations of our antisemitism task force is that they have said that if you are going to chant, it should only be in a certain place, so that people who don't want to hear it are protected from having to hear it.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But protests are by their nature intrusive; it's hard to see the point of a demonstration that's audible only to those who opt in. ''Has there been any disciplinary action taken against students who have chanted, 'From the river to the sea'?'' the New York Republican Elise Stefanik, who scored a major political victory with the previous hearings, asked, citing a common anti-Zionist slogan. Shafik responded, ''We have some disciplinary cases ongoing around that language.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >You don't have to like anti-Israel language or activism to be worried about congressional demands to suppress it. These hearings are highly unusual; it's hard to think of a time since the anti-Communist House Un-American Activities Committee when Congress has made such an effort to investigate disfavored ideologies in academe.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There is no question that in recent months there have been incidents of blatant, unacceptable antisemitism at Columbia: a swastika was drawn in a campus bathroom, and an Israeli student hanging up posters of hostages was assaulted. And as at many other schools, some at Columbia have celebrated terrorism; in an ugly Oct. 8 essay repeatedly cited at the hearings, Massad, the anti-Zionist professor, wrote of ''jubilation and awe'' occasioned by the ''innovative Palestinian resistance'' of Oct. 7. But just as the existence of Communists in America didn't justify McCarthyism, the rhetorical grotesqueries on the part of some members of the campus left don't make it OK for Congress to demand that universities curtail denunciations of Israel while it wages a brutal war on Gaza.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The chilling effect of these investigations is already clear nationwide. Just this week, the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Southern California</span> canceled the graduation speech of its valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, a Muslim criticized by some Jewish groups for her pro-Palestinian social media activity. The decision, the school's provost said in a statement, is ''consistent with the fundamental legal obligation -- including the expectations of federal regulators -- that universities act to protect students and keep our campus community safe,'' making it clear administrators are feeling government pressure.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Such pressure is the point: Republicans want to silence Israel's opponents. In one of the hearing's most farcical moments, Rick Allen, a Republican from Georgia, asked Shafik whether she knew Genesis 12:3. She didn't recall the biblical passage offhand, so he explained it to her. ''It was the covenant that God made with Abraham, and that covenant was real clear: 'If you bless Israel I will bless you, if you curse Israel I will curse you,''' he said, explaining how this compact was confirmed in the New Testament.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Do you consider that a serious issue?'' Allen asked heatedly. ''Do you want <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span> to be cursed by God?'' Shafik responded, ''Definitely not.'' Allen continued, ''Young people are being indoctrinated by these professors to believe this stuff, and they have no idea that they're going to be cursed by God, the God of the Bible and the God over our flag.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This wasn't an exchange, I'd venture, intended to ensure that Jews feel at home in American institutions. Another Republican, Brandon Williams, compared D.E.I. statements to Nazi loyalty oaths. Naturally, no one pushed back.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Just before the hearing began, a group of students from Columbia and its sister school, Barnard, organized a ''Gaza solidarity encampment'' on Columbia's main lawn. On Thursday, Shafik took the extraordinary step of calling the police in to dismantle it, and over 100 people were arrested. The last time the school's administration brought in the N.Y.P.D. to disperse demonstrations was in 1996, and many on campus were in shock.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I never imagined I'd ever see my university acting like this,'' said the legal scholar Katherine Franke, who was coordinating legal defense for the arrested students. ''It breaks my heart.'' (During the congressional hearings, she'd been called out for remarks she'd made about student veterans of the Israeli military.) Among those suspended for participating in the protest was Isra Hirsi, the daughter of Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat who sits on the committee overseeing the antisemitism inquiry.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At the hearing Wednesday, the Texas Republican Nathaniel Moran crowed that Columbia's leadership had clearly ''learned at least some of the lessons from the magnificent failures of Harvard, M.I.T. and <span class=\"companylink\">UPenn</span> when they appeared here several months back.''

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Her international experience was praised when she was appointed. She beat out a pool of roughly 600 nominations for the role, the campus student newspaper, The Columbia Daily Spectator, reported.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The university described her as a ''tireless proponent of diversity and inclusion,'' and one of her first challenges was to help the school respond to the Supreme Court's ban on affirmative action in admissions.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Jonathan Lavine, the former chair of the university's board of trustees, called her the ''perfect candidate'' at the time.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >How She Responded to the Oct. 7 Attacks</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span>-led attacks on Israel, Dr. Shafik called for compassion and civility, and asked the campus community to come together.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But as Columbia grappled with several instances of antisemitism, the administration took stronger stances. In November, the school temporarily suspended two pro-Palestinian student groups -- Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace -- because the university said they had violated its policies.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Around the same time, the school's leadership set up a task force to combat antisemitism, an attempt to address the ''root causes'' of campus hate. It also took some steps to restrict where and when student demonstrations could be held.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For some time, Columbia -- and Dr. Shafik -- seemed to avoid the firestorms embroiling other campuses.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This was largely because Dr. Shafik did not attend a congressional hearing in December on antisemitism on college campuses, because of a preplanned international trip. The presidents of Harvard, the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Pennsylvania</span> and M.I.T. testified and were swiftly and intensely criticized for failing to clearly state that calling for the genocide of Jews would break their universities' rules.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Days later, Columbia updated its own event policy page to say that calls for genocide were ''abhorrent'' and inconsistent with the school's values. Promoting violence, the page said, would ''not be tolerated.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >She appeared to sidestep the land mines that helped precipitate the resignations of the presidents of Harvard and Penn. When questioned on whether calling for genocide violated the school's code of conduct, she did not hedge in her answer: ''Yes, it does,'' she said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And when asked whether a professor who described the Oct. 7 attacks as ''awesome'' would be removed from a leadership position, she ultimately said he would. ''I think that would be -- I think, I would, yes,'' she said.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But back at home, new troubles were brewing.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Pro-Palestinian students had organized an encampment with dozens of tents, and had given the university's leaders a message: They would not leave until their demands -- including that the school divest from businesses with ties to Israel -- were met. Through Wednesday, they were joined by hundreds of other students.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The next day, the university's administration took its most forceful step yet to crackdown on unauthorized demonstrations, asking the city's Police Department to intervene.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Officers arrested at least 108 protesters and dismantled the encampment, as a large crowd shouted ''Shame!'' Some vowed that their spirits would not be shattered. ''They can threaten us all they want with the police, but at the end of the day, it's only going to lead to more mobilization,'' Maryam Alwan, a pro-Palestinian organizer on campus, said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >After the protesters were arrested, Mayor Eric Adams defended Dr. Shafik and said that students did not ''have a right to violate university policies and disrupt learning.'' But the administration's escalation drew swift criticism from legal groups, defenders of free speech and some faculty members.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I'm really worried about a spiral in which suppressing protest is going to lead to more aggressive protest,'' said Angus Johnston, a historian of student activism.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik wrote to the campus on Thursday that she was taking an ''extraordinary step because these are extraordinary circumstances.'' The encampment, she said, ''severely disrupts campus life, and creates a harassing and intimidating environment for many of our students.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We have lost confidence in our president and our administration, and we pledge to fight to reclaim our university,'' the group said in a statement Friday.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In addition, a pro-Palestinian coalition of faculty and staff at Columbia, Barnard and Teachers colleges called upon faculty to boycott graduation and academic events, until the university lifts student suspensions and withdraws financial support from Israel, among other demands.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But not all faculty members agreed with the criticism. Vincent A. Blasi, a Columbia law professor who has spent decades studying civil liberties issues, said the university had articulated a ''reasonable'' policy to govern protests and had every right to punish students who violate it.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It's clear to me that they haven't transgressed here,'' he said. ''You can debate who you ought to be sympathetic with, but in my own mind, I am confident that the students have no First Amendment claim to stay in that space.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The new protest camp at Columbia officially breaks university rules. And some of the chants -- ''We don't want no Zionists here'' and ''Israel is a racist state'' -- are the same ones that President Shafik suggested were creating ''a harassing and intimidating environment for many of our students.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But there seemed to be a lull in enforcement, at least for the moment, as university administrators consider whether they should suspend and arrest even more students for a movement that clearly has considerable campus support. One student organizer said on Friday that protesters had been told by campus security that as long as they did not pitch tents, they could remain there as an informal gathering.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Our community has had protest activity on campus since October, and we expect that activity to continue,'' said Samantha Slater, a university spokeswoman. ''We have rules regarding the time, place and manner that apply to protest activity, and we will continue to enforce those.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Protesters also gathered outside the university's gates on Friday, with someone yelling, ''We are <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span>.'' The nearby headquarters of Hillel, a campus Jewish organization, was nearly empty, unusual for a Friday afternoon.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Daniel Garren, 21, was one of the few students there. Describing himself as half-Ashkenazi Jewish and half-Yemeni, he criticized the members of Congress who grilled Dr. Shafik on Wednesday. ''It was pretty frustrating to watch,'' he said of the congressional hearing. ''A lot of non-Jewish uninformed congresspeople ask our non-Jewish president about matters that they don't seem to have a strong grasp of.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Two students at the protest on Friday said they had been among those arrested on Thursday. Officially, the university said that all students who had been at the encampment had also been suspended, in which case they would be barred from campus. But administrators had yet to notify them individually by email, students said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >According to Columbia, suspended students may not go to class or hand in course work, jeopardizing the chance to finish their semesters. Campus IDs are deactivated, making classrooms and dining halls inaccessible. But suspended students would be able to return to their dorms, a spokeswoman said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Maryam Alwan, an arrested student, described in an interview how protest organizers had carefully arranged safety plans before the police moved in.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >After hearing that the police were entering campus, the protesters sat in two concentric circles. ''Some people were crying, some were completely calm,'' Ms. Alwan said. Their hands were zip-tied, and then they were then put on buses. They spent about eight hours at police headquarters, before being released with trespassing summonses.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The continuing demonstration has upset other students, including those who found the anti-Zionist stance of the protest threatening and antisemitic. Noa Fay, 23, a first-year student at the School of International and Public Affairs, described feeling annoyed and ''emotionally detached'' by the ongoing protests.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I'm Jewish with family in Israel,'' she said. ''The longer that this has gone on it makes clear to me the lunacy of it all.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It was impossible for college officials to tell whether they were even engaging with actual Pomona students -- let alone have an open conversation, said Tracy Arwari, assistant vice president for student affairs at Pomona.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''In the same way we think about anonymity in internet communications, it's really hard to have an argument if you don't know who you're arguing with,'' Ms. Arwari said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But as colleges consider how to rein in the protests, they risk overreaching.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The last six months have really tested the principles that govern speech on campus,'' said Suzanne Nossel, chief executive of PEN America, a writer's group that focuses on supporting free expression.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On one hand, schools need to have room to set rules. But, Ms. Nossel said, ''There is this tension between wanting to enforce the rules and also acknowledging that college is a learning environment. You want people to be able to make mistakes without facing lifelong consequences because if you're too heavy-handed, it can reinforce this sense of grievance.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Students who have been subject to tough disciplinary measures have said they found the process disorienting and sudden. At Vanderbilt, the students who were suspended were barred from campus, unable to stay in their dorm rooms, according to Ezri Tyler, a sophomore gender studies major who participated in the sit-in at the president's office.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Students were panicked and very confused,'' Ms. Tyler said, adding that the school's procedures seemed designed to ''very purposely deny students due process.'' She said that her suspension was lifted and that she is now on probation for 15 months.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Diermeier said that the school had to draw a line somewhere. ''This has nothing to do with free speech. That's a red herring,'' he said, adding that no one has a right to harass.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But as colleges and universities take a harder line, they are running into resistance from students, faculty and outside civil liberties groups that say they are stifling the very kind of expressive freedom academia purports to cherish.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Michigan's draft policy on disruptive conduct, for instance, has been criticized by the Michigan chapter of <span class=\"companylink\">the American Civil Liberties Union</span> as too vague and broad for disallowing activity like impeding the flow of foot traffic on campus and interrupting lectures or performances.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Of course universities have a legitimate interest in prohibiting the kinds of major disruptions that completely shut down official events or make it physically impossible for speakers to communicate their message,'' said Dan Korobkin, legal director of A.C.L.U. Michigan.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''But,'' he added, ''they cannot demand complete passivity from everyone who sets foot on campus.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A <span class=\"companylink\">University of Michigan</span> spokeswoman, Colleen Mastony, said, ''Our goal with the draft disruptive activity policy was to make policies clearer, ensure key terms are well defined.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The university has solicited feedback on the draft, and Dr. Ono said in a recent letter to students and faculty that he would not ''rush the development of this new policy; we will ensure all voices have an opportunity to be heard.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At Vanderbilt, Dr. Diermeier has established an initiative, the Future of Free Speech, to promote free expression beyond college campuses. Jacob Mchangama, the head of that program, said in an interview that he had expressed his differences with Dr. Diermeier over the way the student occupation of the president's office was handled, including when the police arrested a reporter for a local publication who was covering the event.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But, he added, the willingness of some students to push the limits of tolerable conduct necessitates a response from educators. It's the job of professors to say, ''Here are the red lines,'' Mr. Mchangama said. ''And that's one of the issues that's plaguing universities around the country.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Etched into Columbia's history is the brutal police crackdown that its administrators authorized in 1968 against student protesters who were occupying academic buildings.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Now, the university points proudly to that activism as one of the hallmarks of its culture, and markets it to prospective students. On Thursday, Dr. Shafik insisted that university officials ''work hard to balance the rights of students to express political views with the need to protect other students from rhetoric that amounts to harassment and discrimination.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In recent months, she and administrators across the country have felt that tension acutely, as the federal government opened investigations into the handling of bias claims at dozens of schools, Congress subpoenaed records and court dockets filled with lawsuits.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >During her testimony, Dr. Shafik said she had been frustrated ''that Columbia's policies and structures were sometimes unable to meet the moment,'' and said the university had updated many of them. Some of those changes include limiting protests to certain times of day and to designated spots on campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Columbia's tightened rules were being tested even as Dr. Shafik testified. By 7:15 p.m. on Wednesday, Columbia said, the university had issued a written warning to students in the encampment: They had 105 minutes to leave or they would face suspension.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Since the Oct. 7 <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span> attacks on Israel, administrators at Columbia had tried to calibrate their approaches to the demonstrations, balancing free-speech rights with the security of Jewish students.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But before the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce on Wednesday, Dr. Shafik and other Columbia leaders signaled a tougher approach. The co-chair of the university's board, Claire Shipman, declared that there was ''a moral crisis on our campus.'' And Dr. Shafik went so far as to detail some of the disciplinary actions underway, including suspensions and firings.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >That conciliatory approach toward House Republicans infuriated many on campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In New York, some students and faculty members complained that university leaders had largely kowtowed to a Congress whose insistent questioning helped fuel the recent resignations by the presidents of Harvard and the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Pennsylvania</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There has been no indication that Dr. Shafik, who took office last July, has lost the confidence of Columbia's board. Thursday's tactics, though, showed how much more aggressive she has become in her campaign to quell protests.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Five days after the attack on Israel, hundreds of protesters gathered on the campus, and the university shut its gates -- a step that has now become familiar as protests have flared.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But for <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span>, the encampment was anything but an Eden. The university's president, Nemat Shafik, fresh from a congressional hearing in which she had pledged to enforce the university's rules on protests, tried to get the students to stand down. When they did not, she decided to break with a decades-long norm in the university's approach to quelling protests.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The current encampment violates all of the new policies, severely disrupts campus life, and creates a harassing and intimidating environment for many of our students,'' she wrote in a letter to the Columbia community sent around 1:15 p.m. on Thursday.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Within minutes, police officers, many in riot gear, flooded into the campus and surrounded the lawn. Inside the encampment, roughly 100 students linked arms and sat in rows. A large crowd of students and onlookers gathered. The police began to arrest the students, placing their hands into zip ties. The crowd chanted ''shame on you'' and ''let them go.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The protesters did not resist. They had expected they would be arrested, they said, because they had vowed not to move until Columbia divests from companies supporting Israel, something the school has repeatedly said it will not do. The students were all also suspended, the Columbia administration announced.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Many in the crowd watched, they said in interviews, with a sense of disbelief, or anger. Some students, though -- those who had felt harassed by the chants and actions of the pro-Palestinian students -- said they were glad that the university had finally agreed to follow its rules.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The arrested students left behind the remnants of their tent city. Under police watch, Columbia facilities workers began to clear the lawn, throwing items into large plastic bins. They poured boxes of Dunkin' coffee, still hot, onto the ground, creating steam in the light rain. The university issued a statement saying the tents and students' belongings had been placed in storage.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As the camp was dismantled, some onlookers dispersed, but others continued to rally. They relocated a protest to the next lawn to the west. Dozens of students hopped over a fence and formed a circle on the wet grass. ''Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest,'' they chanted.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Cornel West, the public intellectual and independent candidate for president, came to address the students in solidarity. He called Columbia's response to the protesters ''a colossal failure in terms of morality.''</p>\n",

Critics faulted the university for not reaching out early to its Jewish students or alumni with an official statement condemning the attack.

Many declared they would withhold their donations. Some called for new leadership.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But for others watching the conflict, the campaign was unsettling.

When asked a question about whether calling for the genocide of Jews would break their universities' rules, the presidents responded with lawyerly answers that sparked a spiraling backlash.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The December hearing was a political showcase for Elise Stefanik, a New York lawmaker who is the No. 4 Republican in the House and whose questions elicited the most damaging testimony. Afterward, Ms. Stefanik counted the resignations of the president of the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Pennsylvania</span>, M. Elizabeth Magill, and Claudine Gay, the president of Harvard, as personal wins.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I will always deliver results,'' Ms. Stefanik, a Harvard alumna and a prospective vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump, said after Dr. Gay's resignation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Gay, who also faced plagiarism allegations, said she had resigned, in part, to ''deny demagogues the opportunity to further weaponize my presidency.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This hearing may be different, because Dr. Shafik and <span class=\"companylink\">Columbia University</span> already know many of the questions they will face and have had months to prepare.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Since the <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span> attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Columbia has made substantial -- and some say heavy-handed -- efforts to manage campus protests and pro-Palestinian student organizing. Now, Dr. Shafik's college president peers, along with students, faculty and alumni across the political spectrum, will be watching to see whether those efforts will change her reception.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The hearing may also serve as a weather vane indicating how politics surrounding campus protest have shifted in the last six months. Colleges across the country, including Columbia, have been tightening rules and increasing enforcement against campus protests and expression.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Those moves have caused deep concern among faculty members monitoring academic freedom.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''If you don't have vigorous debate on campus, if you don't permit the expression of views that make you uncomfortable, do you have a university anymore?'' said Sheldon Pollock, a professor on the executive committee of the <span class=\"companylink\">American Association of University Professors</span> at Columbia.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >During the earlier hearing, some Republicans homed in on the double standards they argue have infected Ivy League campuses, where conservative thinkers have at times faced sanctions or been barred from speaking, even as protest chants like ''globalize the intifada'' that many Jews find hurtful have been allowed.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >That hearing also made clear that it was not enough to give lawyerly answers about what is permitted speech on campus. Private universities have the power to make their own rules about what can and cannot be said, and they have used that power in the past to shape a safe and inclusive community for other groups.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The presidents ''went into that session beautifully prepared to discuss the really hard constitutional questions about whether a speech about a Jewish genocide is protected or not under the First Amendment,'' said Burt Neuborne, a civil liberties lawyer at <span class=\"companylink\">New York University</span> and the founding legal director of the Brennan Center for Justice, about the December hearing.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''But that wasn't the question,'' he added. ''The question was: What do you want to do on your campus? If you have the power to build your campus, what kind of a campus do you want to build?''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Supporters of Dr. Shafik, who goes by her nickname, Minouche, are hoping she will benefit from her decades of experience with diplomacy in high-profile settings. She is an economist who, before joining Columbia last summer, held senior leadership roles at the <span class=\"companylink\">World Bank</span>, the <span class=\"companylink\">International Monetary Fund</span> and the <span class=\"companylink\">Bank of England</span> and was president of the <span class=\"companylink\">London School of Economics and Political Science</span>. She has already put on the record a direct answer to the question that tripped up the other presidents: whether calling for the genocide of Jews would break university rules.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Calls for genocide against the Jewish community or any other group are abhorrent, inconsistent with our values and against our rules,'' the Columbia website now states. ''Incitement to violence against members of our community will not be tolerated.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the delay -- Dr. Shafik missed the last hearing because of a scheduling conflict -- also brings disadvantages. The last several months at Columbia have been marked with protests, social media spats, lawsuits and news coverage of the university's response, all for the House committee to critique. Columbia has been asked to submit voluminous documentation about how it has responded to antisemitism allegations since 2021.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some Jewish students say being on campus since Oct. 7 has been deeply uncomfortable. One Jewish student was hit with a stick after putting up posters of Israeli hostages, in an incident that led to an arrest. Some say they have been cursed at for being Jewish. Others describe more subtle harms, such as feeling socially excluded from clubs, or being repeatedly asked about their position on Israel.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Since Oct. 7, ''the acceptance of antisemitism and the acceptance of speaking against Jewish people because of their connection to Israel has become more prevalent throughout campus and become more acceptable throughout campus,'' said Rebecca Massel, a sophomore and reporter for The Columbia Spectator.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In response, Columbia and its sister school, Barnard, have sought to rein in pro-Palestinian student activism, but that has led to allegations that they are repressing free speech. The university suspended two pro-Palestinian student groups after they repeatedly held unauthorized protests.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Columbia says many pro-Palestinian students have been doxxed, their identities publicized on the internet and displayed on a truck circling campus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At least 160 students have had some kind of disciplinary action started against them in connection with campus events since Oct. 7, according to Columbia. In early April, Columbia administrators suspended five students it accused of involvement in an unauthorized student event, Resistance 101, at which the invited speakers spoke openly in support of <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span> and other U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''There is nothing wrong with being a member of <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span>, being a leader of <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span>, being a fighter in <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span>,'' Charlotte Kates, the international coordinator of the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, told attendees, according to a video posted on social media.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The students, who are being evicted from university housing, said that they had not yet had a chance to defend themselves.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It's not a coincidence that this is happening right before Minouche Shafik has to appear before Congress,'' said Aidan Parisi, 27, a suspended student from the School of Social Work. He is still fighting his eviction, which would mean finding housing that would accept his emotional support rabbit. ''Unfortunately, she is willing to risk our housing, and overall well-being, for her career.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Shafik has defended her increasingly tough approach.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I did not become a university president to punish students,'' she said in a statement. ''At the same time, actions like this on our campus must have consequences.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >She added: ''I want to make clear that it is absolutely unacceptable for any member of this community to promote the use of terror or violence.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Columbia's situation is especially fraught. About 20 percent of its undergraduates are Jewish, according to estimates by Hillel, a national Jewish campus organization, compared with 10 percent at Harvard and 6 percent at M.I.T.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Columbia also attracts many Israeli students and staff, with a dual degree program with <span class=\"companylink\">Tel Aviv University</span> and an academic center in Tel Aviv.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At the same time, Columbia is a hub for Palestinian scholarship, with more than two dozen faculty members affiliated with its Center for Palestine Studies, including the influential historian Rashid Khalidi. Columbia was also the academic home of one of the most prominent Palestinian American intellectuals, Edward Said, who died in 2003.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >These factors spilled into view when, after Oct. 7, hundreds of students began demonstrating against Zionism and in favor of a free Palestine, next to a smaller contingent of pro-Israel counterprotesters who held up Israeli flags and pictures of hostages.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Facing lawsuits and a federal civil rights investigation into antisemitism on campus, Columbia debuted a new interim demonstration policy in February. Protests can now happen only on weekday afternoons in certain ''demonstration areas,'' and not next to the Alma Mater statue, a potent symbol of the university. The school has also formed an antisemitism task force, whose first report endorsed the new protest policies.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While these moves have reduced the number of protests, pro-Palestinian organizers are still active. An unauthorized but peaceful protest against Israeli attacks in Gaza took place in early April with well over 100 students marching.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The next day, Dr. Shafik said that the school would identify the participants, ''and they will face discipline under our policies.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The <span class=\"companylink\">Council on American-Islamic Relations</span>, a Muslim civil rights organization, also condemned the decision to cancel the speech as ''cowardly'' and demanded that U.S.C. reverse it.</p>\n",

Her brother Alan, who also protested, was shot in the wrist.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"I couldn't go anywhere without hearing people talk about the war,\" she said. \"It was our generation being sent off to sacrifice their lives in even what the architects were calling an unwinnable war.\"</p>\n",

        "# Discussion and Conclusion\n",
        "The individual bar charts generated highlight differences in how student-run and national publications discussed the encampments. Notably, words like \"solidarity\" and \"arrest\" are among the top 20 most significant words used by student-run publications. While \"arrested\" similarly appears among the top terms for national news outlets, words such as \"anti-Semitism,\" \"commencement,\" \"state,\" and \"Hamas\" are identified as significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "These differences suggest varying narrative focuses. Student-run publications appear to focus on student experiences, potentially framing the encampments as expressions of solidarity. Conversely, national news outlets emphasize allegations of anti-Semitism and broader national or political implications of the protests. Such is evidenced by the presence of words such as \"country,\" \"political,\" \"American,\" and \"China\" for The New York Times and \"political\" and \"country\" for The Wall Street Journal. This finding is particularly striking given the divergent political leanings of the national outlets included in the analysis, further underscoring how national news outlets framed the protests as manifestations of anti-Semitism and disruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the grouped bar charts show that \"arrest\" is a common term, they further clarify the divergence between the two types of publications. Among the top 20 TF-IDF words for national news outlets are \"commencement,\" \"anti-Semitism,\" \"state,\" \"war,\" \"political,\" \"divestment,\" \"country, and \"violence.\" On the other hand, student-run publications feature words like \"support,\" \"refuse,\" \"experience,\" \"solidarity,\" \"demand,\" \"safety,\" and \"disciplinary.\" These results reinforce the notion that student-run publications focused on the communal and experiential aspects of the protests, while national news outlets framed the encampments through a lens of violence, alleged anti-Semitism, and potentially detrimental national, business, or political implications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that anti-Semitism is present, it is interesting that the term \"Islamophobia\" is absent from both groups. The absence of the word \"genocide\" from both groups is also interesting as \"war\" is identified as a significant word utilized by national publications. Ultimately, the findings support the hypothesis that the two groups of outlets presented divergent perspectives on the campus protests, with national news outlets focusing on its alleged anti-Semitic aspect, reflecting their distinct audiences and objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Limitations and Further Research\n",
        "\n",
        "Aside from restrictions on using publications such as Columbia's Daily Spectator, this project faced several limitations, including analyzing only a sample of 20 articles from each publication. Future research could expand the timeframe of article collection to include a larger sample and analyze a broader range of publications, potentially increasing the generalizability of the results. Specifically, including student-run publications from conservative colleges may provide further insight into how students across the political spectrum covered the protests. Additionally, an analysis focusing on when certain terms were used more frequently than others could also provide deeper insights into how news sources portrayed the event and how such may have related to broader political events.\n",
